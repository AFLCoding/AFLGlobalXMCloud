        <p>Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /">AFL</a> presented a $14,500 donation to the <a href="http://www.jdrf.ca/">Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation</a>(JDRF), a national organization committed to developing a cure for Type 1 diabetes. Made possible by AFL Canadian associates and AFL’s <a href=" /Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a>, the donation was the culmination of an employee engagement campaign to support diabetes research. With this campaign, AFL now ranks as one of JDRF’s top three corporate donors in the British Columbia/Yukon Region. </p>
        <div>“Our associates’ dedication to improving the lives of others grows each year,” commented Brian Lund, president of AFL’s Network Services Division in Canada. “We are committed to living out our core values—community engagement being one. I am proud and privileged to be associated with this great AFL team.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL held a variety of activities to generate enthusiasm and support for the cause including bake sales, an open-air vendor market, prize raffles and associate donations. Alongside these activities, one of JDRF’s youth ambassadors joined the Surrey BC office to share her story regarding the impact Type 1 diabetes has had on her life and how JDRF has supported her in overcoming the daily regime of insulin injections, pumps and monitoring her diet, all while continuing her day-to-day life as an active 10-year-old.</div>
        <p>For over 40 years, JDRF has been a global leader in the search for an end to Type 1 diabetes. JDRF’s research is committed to improving the lives of those with Type 1 diabetes through projects supported in three therapeutic areas—cure, treatment and prevention. These areas are a step in JDRF’s efforts to move the diabetes research landscape toward a cure.<br />
