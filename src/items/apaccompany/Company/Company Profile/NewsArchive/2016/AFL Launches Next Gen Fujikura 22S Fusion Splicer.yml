        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a> introduces the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers-Single-Fiber/Fujikura-22S-Fusion-Splicer">Fujikura 22S</a> active cladding alignment fusion splicer. With moveable v-grooves, splicer errors due to dust and other contaminants are virtually eliminated. Removable sheath clamps allow the use of fiber holders and the large monitor provides a crystal clear image, even in bright sunlight.<br />
         <br />
        “Fujikura continues to improve upon fusion splicing technology by incorporating newer features that make splicing easier,” commented Greg Pickeral, product manager for AFL’s fusion splicing systems. “The Fujikura 22S incorporates many of the advanced features of our more expensive models yet retains the quality and reliability they are known for.”<br />
         <br />
        The fully ruggedized chassis provides for shock, dust and moisture protection while the two camera observation system provides for accurate fiber alignment and loss estimation calculations. Additional features include a long-life battery that provides power for up to 200 splice cycles (including the application of the splice sleeve), and the electrode life which has been extended to 5,000 splices, minimizing downtime for replacement and stabilizations. The transit case and work tray provide multiple options for utilizing workspace.<br />
         <br />
        <a href="http://content.aflglobal.com/Product-Registration.html">Software updates</a> are available via the Internet allowing users to quickly update their software as new splice programs become available. The Fujikura 22S is also fully compatible with the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Field-Installable-Connectors/Splice-On-Connectors-FuseConnect-Fusion-Splice">FUSEConnect®</a> line of fusion installable connectors. Ideal for field splicing, the 22S maintains high quality in the most extreme environments.<br />
         <br />
        AFL operates the only authorized repair facility for Fujikura splicing products in the U.S. Technical support is available 24/7 and complimentary on-site training is available with every splicer purchased.<br />
