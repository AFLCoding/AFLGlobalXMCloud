        Spartanburg, SC — AFL is launching a keyed housing for the LC FuseConnect fusion splice connector, the latest addition to its family of FuseConnect products. Featuring just four components, the keyed LC housing utilizes the current FuseConnect LC design feature, swapping the standard LC housing with the keyed housing. With the keyed housing, this product provides a secure network solution, suitable for backbone network infrastructure and Fiber-to-the-Desk.<br />
        <br />
        The keyed LC housing is available in six different keying configurations, each with its own color designation. The physical keying feature inside the housing is designed to be compatible only with the same keyed color adapter configurations. Both LC keyed housings and adapters are designed to be tamper proof, prevent unauthorized connections and will not connect with generic LC connectors or adapters.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s FuseConnect fusion-splice field-terminated connector family is uniquely designed and easy to use. With a factory pre-terminated end-face, its innovative field termination process eliminates the need for polishing, adhesives and crimping in the field. The FuseConnect utilizes a fusion splicer to terminate the connector, addressing return loss concerns present in analog optical networks. This advanced process yields true APC performance of >65dB return loss in an APC configuration. Designed to work with a 10mm cleave length and with splicers that utilize a fiber holder system, FuseConnect is compatible not only with Fujikura’s fusion splicers, but also with other industry-available fiber holder-based fusion splicing platforms.<br />
        <br />
        The four-component structure of FuseConnect eliminates the complexity associated with additional crimp ring parts, thereby virtually eliminating the crimping operation. The simplified field installation minimizes the potential for operator error and expensive connector scrap, even in difficult field environments or in exposed conditions at remote site locations.<br />
        <br />
        Available in single-mode or multimode (62.5µm, 50µm, and 50µm 10GIG (OM3)), the connector is designed to meet or exceed TIA/EIA 568C.3 and TIA/EIA-604-10A (FOCIS 10) requirements. For additional information, visitwww.AFLglobal.com.<br />
