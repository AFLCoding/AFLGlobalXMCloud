        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> announces it now offers the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/xWDM-Test/WDM900-Lightwave-Test-Set.aspx">WDM900 Lightwave Test Set</a> with both CWDM and DWDM test capability from a single port. Initially launched with DWDM capability only, the WDM900 simplifies in-service testing of DWDM and CWDM access networks that support <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Solutions/Cellular-Backhaul.aspx">cellular backhaul</a>, <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Solutions/Metro-Ethernet.aspx">metro Ethernet</a> and <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Industries/Service-and-Content-Providers.aspx">CATV/broadband services</a>.<br />
        <br />
        “The WDM900 was designed with field use in mind and provides the perfect alternative to deploying an OSA into the field for testing or troubleshooting,” commented Lee Kellett, director of product marketing. “The unit tests CWDM and DWDM from a single port, so technicians can test mixed networks and  know they will get the right results every time.”<br />
        <br />
        The WDM900’s many features include the intuitive Health Meter display that graphically summarizes network performance on all channels with an easy-to-interpret, color-coded indicator. Simply touching a channel launches the Channel Detail display, which shows graphically and numerically how the measured attributes compare to the acceptance criteria. Performance requirements can be easily customized in the set up menu, allowing customers to adjust pass/fail criteria as well as color codes for reporting pass/fail/borderline conditions.<br />
        <br />
        Customers can upgrade their DWDM units to add full functionality that includes<br />
        CWDM. The DWDM-only model is still available for customers who do not need CWDM field test capability. The WDM900 is currently available and <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Contact/Request-Demo/Test-and-Inspection.aspx">demos</a> can be requested.<br />
