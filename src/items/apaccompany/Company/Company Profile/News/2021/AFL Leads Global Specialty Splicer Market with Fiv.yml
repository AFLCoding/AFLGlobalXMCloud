        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, introduces a new series of LAZERMaster&reg; Fiber Optic Glass Processing stations&mdash;the&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=7C5342F99F2E4CEA8314BA7EC382E4BC&amp;_z=z">LZM-125M/P</a>;&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=010AB67BEF3546D9A559C6D3A2BA3DAF&amp;_z=z">LZM-125M+/P+</a>; and&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F33349693D2346A3933ED74A44218347&amp;_z=z">LZM-125A+</a>. The LZM-125 series consists of splicing glass processing systems and fiber ablation machines that use a CO2 laser heat source to perform splicing, tapering, lensing, ablation (for cleaving and mode stripping) and other glass shaping operations with glass diameters up to 2.0 mm. The high-resolution optical analysis system works in conjunction with on-board firmware for fully automatic splicing, tapering and other glass shaping processes.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &ldquo;Building on Fujikura&rsquo;s 40+ year history of splicing knowledge as well as AFL&rsquo;s extensive history of laser glass processing, the new family of LZM-125&rsquo;s rounds out our product offering in the laser splicing and glass processing marketplace,&rdquo; explained Brad Hendrix, global specialty&nbsp; market manager of AFL/Fujikura. &ldquo;The entire suite of LZM-125 laser glass processing systems are designed to address more specific production applications while refraining from adding features not required for these applications.&rdquo;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        Each machine provides an advantage within an area of the specialty splicing and glass processing market. For example, the&nbsp;LZM-125M&nbsp;is based on the FSM-100M family of Fujikura splicers with the added advantage of a clean CO2 laser heat source and an increased fiber handling capacity up to 2.0mm fiber diameters. The LZM-125M would be ideal for high reliability factory splicing in the medical or fiber laser market. With CO2 heating, contaminates cannot be induced by the heating source. The glass is heated through absorption of CO2 laser photons providing the cleanest heating source available.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        For applications such as end capping or large ball lensing as well as tapers less than 32mm, the&nbsp;LZM-125P+&nbsp;with fiber rotation and end view is an ideal solution. The&nbsp;LZM-125A+&nbsp;has similar features to the FSM-125P+ with the additional capability of ablation. This allows for the manufacture of products that have glass removed from the surface such as cladding mode stripper or shaped fiber tips.&nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        The FPS PC control GUI is supplied with all LZM products and provides additional features, greater flexibility and finer control. The FPS GUI allows customers to also create proprietary PC control algorithms using a complete set of PC control commands.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
