        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, recognized several associates with patent awards received for developing new products and technologies within the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E545E2A90D414F31BDD0BA9B8ED27FD0&_z=z">fiber optic cable</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&_z=z">connectivity</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=67697A36EE374C21A1F009672463F0E6&_z=z">test and inspection</a> divisions.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s fiber optic cable division received two patents. The first, titled “ultra-high fiber density micro-duct cable with extreme operating performance,” is for outside plant MicroCore®. The ultra-high fiber density micro-duct cables utilize 48 (250 µm fiber O.D.) or 72 fibers (200 µm fiber O.D.) per tube, while maintaining the 3 mm buffer tube O.D. These designs operate within typical OSP temperature environments, are suitable for mid-span access, and can withstand significant compression and impact loads. The second patent is for “Round and Small Diameter Optical Cables with a Ribbon-like Optical Fiber Structure.” This is an expansion of the use of the SpiderWeb Ribbon® technology and provides additional value to customers enabling them to take advantage of ribbon splicing and fiber organization without sacrificing cable size or flexibility.  <br />
        <br />
        AFL’s test and inspection division received four patents. The first was for “Optical Fiber Test Apparatus with combined light measurement and fault detection.” This invention encapsulates the integration of a Visible Light Identifier with an Optical Power Meter providing users a fast debug/troubleshooting capability. The next was for “Shooting long fiber spans with high loss fiber” which was developed to provide per-event detail on high-loss/long-span fibers beyond the standard capability of an OTDR (e.g. > 70dB). The solution combines the capability of an OLTS and OTDR to create an overall detailed long-span trace. Another patent was received for “Method for pre- and post-image association in fiber optic inspection,” the features of which provides users with the ability to pair fiber end-face images (e.g. Before/After, PC/BH) supporting better documentation and reporting. And finally, the patent titled, “Distributed test system architecture” applies to distributed architecture which separates a test and measurement system into key components of which all are interchangeable on a hardware and software level.<br />
        <br />
        Finally, AFL’s connectivity division received two patents. The patent titled, “Optical Connection Terminals for Fiber Optic Communications Networks” allows AFL’s multiport terminals to connect directly to AFL’s broad line of ADSS cables, making long span aerial deployment available for FTTx applications. And the patent titled, “Optical connector attachment tool having light transmissive wedge” further enhances AFL’s portfolio of field-installable connectors. This technology provides a clear indication to the technician that the connector is fully-engaged with the fiber.<br />
