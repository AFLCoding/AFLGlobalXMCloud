        <div>AFL Encourages STEM Education with $10K Grant to Spartanburg Science Center<br />
        Spartanburg, SC – February 18, 2019 – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, is supporting STEM education with a $10,000 grant to the <a href="https://www.spartanburgsciencecenter.org/">Spartanburg Science Center</a> (SSC) and its <a href="https://www.spartanburgsciencecenter.org/hub-city-robotics/">Hub City Robotics</a> program. The <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">grant</a> will provide new equipment as well as scholarships for students, making clubs and summer camps available to those who love robotics.<br />
        <br />
        “Being able to offer scholarships to Priority One students; purchasing new educational robotic equipment and teaching them how to use the equipment; making summer camps and clubs available to every student who loves robotics; and creating yearlong learning is a powerful tool in STEM education,” explained Mary Levens, interim director for the Spartanburg Science Center. “Couple that with teamwork, learning to accept others ideas, modify your own thinking and create a project judged by impartial judges creates its own rewards. We feel certain that this is STEM education at its best.”<br />
        <br />
        The Spartanburg Science Center pulled all its activities under one umbrella known as Hub City Robotics. STEM programs, activities and events are offered in all areas of science, and include LEGO® robotics, coding camps and the annual Junior First LEGO League Expo.<br />
        <br />
        Hub City Robotics is providing after school clubs and summer camps under one roof for children ages 4-12, and is striving to make STEM activities more accessible for students from low income households. All camps and clubs are taught by certified teachers who are passionate about educating children in STEM.<br />
        <br />
        Hub City Robotics has a passion to demonstrate STEM as a viable avenue to a better life and to a strong workforce. They are working to meet the need to keep children in our community educated and coming back to our community as a productive members of the work force. AFL’s grant is helping to support Hub City’s initiative of life-long learning.<br />
