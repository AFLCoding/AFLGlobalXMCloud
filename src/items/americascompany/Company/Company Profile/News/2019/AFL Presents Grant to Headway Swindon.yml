        <div>Swindon, UK and Spartanburg, SC –<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/"> AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, awarded a £3,000 grant to <a href="http://www.headwayswindon.org.uk/">Headway Swindon</a>, an organization that offers cognitive rehabilitation with the aim to redevelop lost skills such as memory, attention, emotional adjustment and planning, ultimately helping individuals realise their full potential. The grant will support the purchase of a new Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) system.<br />
        <br />
        “Headway Swindon is forward thinking and needs a system that can move with us and support a growing service,” said Jane Weston, Chief Executive Officer of Headway Swindon. “Currently, we use several databases which are old and unreliable. We spend time accessing several sites to gain the information required.”<br />
         <br />
        Headway Swindon supports up to 94 adults affected by brain injury plus their families in the Swindon area each week. The CRM system will enable Headway Swindon to consolidate data, improving efficiency and data protection.<br />
         <br />
        Jo Lawrence, sales and marketing coordinator at AFL explained, “Headway Swindon is supported through our annual fundraising campaign and it was through this relationship we became aware of the need for a grant. We are proud to support them and their endeavours to provide a smooth running service for all their clients and supporters.”<br />
         <br />
