        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank">AFL</a>, an industry-leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment, and accessories, is exhibiting at the&nbsp;<a href="https://2021.otcnet.org/">Offshore Technology Conference (OTC)</a>&nbsp;in Houston, Texas. Visit AFL in booth #2253 to learn more about hybrid electro-optical and high-temperature downhole cables plus low-loss, metal-coated optical fibers rated for temperatures up to 500⁰C.<br />
        AFL recently industrialized its&nbsp;4mm Hybrid Electro-Optical Downhole Cable&nbsp;to achieve continuous lengths up to 25,000 feet while delivering 12 fiber positions and voltages up to 1000V on an 18 AWG conductor. The 4mm armor has a nominal wall thickness of .028&rdquo;, providing substantial hydrostatic pressure resistance, tensile strength and column strength. This hybrid downhole cable has been tested at temperatures up to 175&deg;C.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        AFL also further industrialized its&nbsp;High-Temperature Downhole Cable&nbsp;design to reliably achieve longer continuous lengths.&nbsp;Constructed with a three-layer, all-metal design, the high-temperature downhole cable provides both an inner and outer layer of stainless-steel tubing to protect against temperatures and pressures associated with well environments, and a middle layer of aluminum to inhibit hydrogen permeability and extend the life of the optical fiber. By using an all-metal design, the concern of polymers at elevated temperatures is eliminated and a more stable performance is achieved. As the use of engineered fibers, which may not have a carbon layer or hydrogen resistant glass chemistry, proliferates, AFL&rsquo;s updated high temperature downhole cable design provides a unique solution to hydrogen resistance that might not otherwise be available for these fibers.<br />
        <br />
        The&nbsp;500⁰C VHT500 single-mode and VHT5000 multimode fibers&nbsp;feature advanced glass chemistries for improved performance in hydrogen-rich environments and excellent optical performance in permanent, long-term exposure to temperatures up to 500⁰C. Maximum attenuation of the VHT Series is 5dB/km for all typical operating wavelengths.<br />
        <br />
