        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;"><strong>Spartanburg, SC</strong> - Employees at AFL in Duncan volunteered their time Saturday morning, May 16, to assist Diligent Hands Gracious Hearts (DHGH), a non-profit organization dedicated to providing free basic home and lawn maintenance to the elderly/physically challenged citizens in the Greenville area.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Twenty-five volunteers, 14 of which were AFL associates, kicked off the event at 8:00 a.m. on a rainy Saturday morning. Dividing into four teams, each team provided with a truck and GPS, 4 lawn mowers, one blower and one weed-eater, the teams hit the streets wasting no time to tend to a total of 24 houses!</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">“This was an amazing opportunity to provide assistance to those in need,” said Corie Culp, Community Relations Manager for AFL. “And meeting the home owners was even more meaningful! Everyone was so gracious and thankful for our efforts.”</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">The volunteer effort was part of AFL's SPIRIT grant program which matches the “sweat equity” of AFL employees with a $3,000 grant to the organization chosen for community service. The check was presented to Todd Wilklow, Founder and Executive Director of Diligent Hands Gracious Hearts.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">“What a great group of employees and what a great company that encourages and supports service in the community,” stated Wilklow. “All the volunteers were real troopers working in adverse conditions with enthusiasm and purpose.”</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Diligent Hands Gracious Hearts is in motion constantly! DHGH currently serves over 100 individuals providing them with lawn care and fellowship twice a month. Visit www.dhgh.org for additional information.</p>
