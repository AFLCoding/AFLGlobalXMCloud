        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> awarded the <a href="http://www.middletyger.org/">Middle Tyger Community Center</a> (MTCC) a $15,000 grant made possible by AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>. The grant supports the Center’s Family Counseling and Play Therapy Center which provides mental health services including individual therapy, family therapy and play therapy for children. Funds from the grant will provide these services to families with children and adolescents who would not otherwise be able to afford counseling services.<br />
        <br />
        “The need for mental health and counseling services for children and families is critical in our community. With an estimated 20 percent of children suffering from a diagnosable mental illness, only one in five receives treatment,” commented Andrea Moore, executive director of MTCC. “When children feel disconnected from their parents, teachers, peers and society, they are more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors. MTCC is making a difference in these children by helping them cope.”<br />
        <br />
        Through the counseling services of MTCC, children are able to develop a positive self-esteem, assume greater responsibility, learn the process of coping, engage in decision-making and problem-solving and learn new social skills. The Center serves an average of 120 families per week for counseling during a year.<br />
        <br />
        The Middle Tyger Community Center mission is to create healthy families. Through programs including Early Childhood Education, Adult Education, District Five Family Ministries and Family Counseling and Play Therapy, MTCC will provide assistance to more than 12,000 children and families over the course of one year.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL is committed to supporting its communities to reach a broader audience and make a difference in the lives of others,” stated Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “MTCC shares this vision and has already made a substantial impact right here in Spartanburg. We are excited to partner with them to support their efforts.”<br />
        <br />
