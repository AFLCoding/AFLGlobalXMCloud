        Spartanburg, SC and Tukwila, WA – Announcing the release of its <a href="http://www.lightbrigade.com/mydocuments/pro_av_2013_classes.pdf?utm_source=tlb&utm_medium=email&utm_term=PR&utm_campaign=AVPR">Fiber Optics for Pro A/V</a> training course, <a href="http://www.lightbrigade.com/?utm_source=tlb&utm_medium=email&utm_term=PR&utm_campaign=AVPR">The Light Brigade</a>, <a href=" /default ">AFL</a>’s training division, is introducing a new industry-specific fiber training course to address the use of fiber optics in the pro A/V and broadcast industries. The course is focused on those who design, install, maintain and troubleshoot fiber optic systems and spans.<br />
         <br />
        The growth in video bandwidth demand is driving the need for expansion into fiber optics technology. This requires a thorough understanding of the types of fiber optic systems, bandwidth requirements, optical interfaces and various types of transmission products, optical cables and connectors. This three-day course is comprised of 12 hours of classroom instruction followed by 12 hours of hands-on fiber optic training including system testing and troubleshooting. In addition, the course covers fiber handling, cable preparation and terminations, plus inspection, cleaning, testing and troubleshooting.<br />
         <br />
        “Educating the audio visual and broadcast professional in both the knowledge and hands-on skills related to fiber optics was a core target in the design and development of the course,” stated Jim Clodfelter, marketing manager for The Light Brigade. “After collaborating with InfoComm International, we developed a class designed specific to the industry inclusive of InfoComm Recertification Units.”<br />
         <br />
        Regularly scheduled classes start in July and will be offered in the following cities: Orlando, Dallas, Las Vegas, Atlanta, Chicago, San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles.<br />
        <br />
        Custom classes are also available.
