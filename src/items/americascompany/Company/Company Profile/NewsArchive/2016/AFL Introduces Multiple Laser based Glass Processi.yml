        Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /">AFL</a>, a global manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, is introducing the LAZERMaster™ <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/LZM-110M-110P ">LZM-110M, LZM-110P</a>, <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/LZM-110M-110P-LAZERMaster-Laser-Splicing-System ">LZM-110M+ and LZM-100P+</a>  splicing and glass processing systems that uses a CO2 laser heat source to perform splicing, tapering (to create MFAs), lensing or other glass shaping operations with glass diameters up to 2.3 mm. The entire suite of LZM-110 laser glass processing systems are designed to address more specific production applications while reducing features not required.<br />
         <br />
        “While building on the 30+ year history of Fujikura’s <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing ">splicing</a> knowledge as well as our extensive history of laser glass processing with the <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/LAZERMaster-LZM-100-Laser-Splicing-System ">LZM-100</a>, we believe that this new family of LZM-110’s will fill out our product offering in the laser splicing and glass processing marketplace,” explained Brad Hendrix, global specialty market manager for AFL/Fujikura. “Our extensive knowledge in working with optical fibers using a CO2 laser has allowed us to create solutions for multiple specific applications that our customer have requested.”<br />
         <br />
        The LAZERMaster’s high resolution optical analysis system works in conjunction with on-board firmware for fully automatic splicing, tapering and other glass shaping processes. By using CO2 heating, contamination induced by the heating source is eliminated. The glass is heated through absorption of CO2 laser photons providing the cleanest heating source available.<br />
         <br />
        Each of the new laser glass processing system provides an advantage within an area of the specialty splicing and glass processing market.<br />
         <br />
        <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/LZM-110M-110P ">LZM-100M</a>/<a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/LZM-110M-110P-LAZERMaster-Laser-Splicing-System ">M+</a>: Ideal for high reliability factory splicing in the medical or fiber laser market, this laser splicer has the added advantage of a clean CO2 laser heat source and an increased fiber handling capacity up to 2.3 mm fiber diameters.<br />
         <br />
        <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/LZM-110M-110P ">LZM-100P</a>/<a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/LZM-110M-110P-LAZERMaster-Laser-Splicing-System ">P+</a>: For applications such as end capping or large ball lensing as well as tapers less than 32 mm, this laser splicer with fiber rotation and endview (the latter in the LZM-110P+ only) is an ideal solution. <br />
         <br />
        AFL operates the only authorized repair facility for <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing ">Fujikura splicing products</a> in the U.S. AFL technicians are fully trained in repair and adjustment procedures in strict accordance with Fujikura specifications and provide 24/7 technical support as well as complimentary on-site training with every splicer purchased.<br />
