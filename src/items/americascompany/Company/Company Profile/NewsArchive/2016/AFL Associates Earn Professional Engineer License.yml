        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a> , a leading manufacturer and provider of services, announces that Kelvin Turner, design engineer and Steven Kranz, product application engineer for AFL’s <a href="/Products/Conductor-Accessories">accessories division</a>, are recipients of the <a href="http://www.llr.state.sc.us/pol/engineers/">Professional Engineer license</a> awarded by the South Carolina State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Surveyors. Over a period of eight years, both associates completed the requirements for state licensure which includes completing a four-year college degree at an accredited university, working under a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) for a period of four years and passing two exams—the Fundamentals of Engineering and the Principles and Practices of Engineering.<br />
        <br />
        Both Turner and Kranz entered AFL’s co-op program while in college and earned degrees in mechanical engineering from Clemson University. After graduation, Turner joined the AFL team full-time as a design engineer in the accessories division, working on a number of projects during his time at AFL, most notably the <a href="/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Substation-Accessories/Swage-Bus-Accessories">Swage line of substation accessories</a>. He has submitted four requests for product patents, one in collaboration with Steven Kranz.<br />
        <br />
        Kranz is a product application engineer in the accessories division. He has worked extensively on research and development for dampers in <a href="/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Motion-Control-Accessories">motion control accessories</a> to increase their performance. Both associates have worked diligently toward achieving their PE licenses, studying for the exam for a full three months while continuing to work full time.<br />
        <br />
        “Given the amount of preparation, this is a huge accomplishment and milestone in their careers,” stated Ben Freeman, engineering manager and licensed PE at AFL who oversaw Turner and Kranz while they worked toward their licenses. “Being licensed Professional Engineers will give Steven and Kelvin instant technical credibility with customers and suppliers. They are a great asset to AFL and we are very proud of their achievements.”<br />
        <br />
        PE licensure is the highest standard of excellence in the engineering profession. It distinguishes the engineer in the eyes of employers, clients, the government and the general public.<br />
