        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, recognized several associates for patent awards received for developing new products and technologies within the optical connectivity and accessories divisions.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/AFL-Patent-Award-Winners_Oct-2017a.aspx" target="_blank"></a>AFL’s optical connectivity division received four patents. Three of these are technical advances associated with high-reliability connectors for subsea and harsh-environment applications. These include a “High Reliability Armored Termination/Epoxy Gland,” “Connector Housing with Press Fit Boot Seal,” and a “Wire Bend Fixture.” The fourth patent is for an “Optical Trunk Cable with Web-connected Sub-unitized Configuration.” This invention helps bring optical fibers directly into homes and multiple dwelling units (MDUs) for FTTH (Fiber-to-the-Home) applications.<br />
         <br />
        AFL’s accessories division received a patent for “Conductor Connector Accessories and Methods for Connecting Conductors to Conductor Connector Accessories.” The patented design provides a unique “core grip” for transmission dead ends and joints. When incorporated into the accessory, it provides greater bending strength, heat dissipation and will not loosen on the conductor core (even at high temperature operation). The “Single Stage Compression” (one die) cuts installation time in half and void-free design does not require compound.<br />
