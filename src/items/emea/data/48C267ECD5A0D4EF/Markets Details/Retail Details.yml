        <p>As retail continues to evolve, many stores are focusing on the customer experience across channels and the rapidly changing behaviors of consumers themselves. While electronic commerce is growing in popularity, many retailers are also renewing their emphasis on the in-store experience.</p>
        <p>To accommodate this shift, as well as to provide the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that lie ahead, retailers need a robust wireless and wired network infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Not only must their networks meet today&rsquo;s demands, they also need next-generation components and capabilities to protect their infrastructure for the future.</p>
        <p>AFL assists retailers with new store installations as well as remodels and new technology deployments.</p>
        <p>Retail managers have long partnered with multiple vendors to complete mission-critical projects they are tasked with. Managing the logistics of multiple vendors is often overwhelming and can lead to missed timelines and changed orders. Choosing an experienced retail technology partner will help you reach completions and maintain budgets.</p>

        <p>As retail continues to evolve, many stores are focusing on the customer experience across channels and the rapidly changing behaviors of consumers themselves. While electronic commerce is growing in popularity, many retailers are also renewing their emphasis on the in-store experience.</p>
        <p>To accommodate this shift, as well as to provide the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that lie ahead, retailers need a robust wireless and wired network infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Not only must their networks meet today&rsquo;s demands, they also need next-generation components and capabilities to protect their infrastructure for the future.</p>
        <p>AFL assists retailers with new store installations as well as remodels and new technology deployments.</p>
        <p>Retail managers have long partnered with multiple vendors to complete mission-critical projects they are tasked with. Managing the logistics of multiple vendors is often overwhelming and can lead to missed timelines and changed orders. Choosing an experienced retail technology partner will help you reach completions and maintain budgets.</p>
