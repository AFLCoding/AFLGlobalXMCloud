        <div>AFL offers a wide range of fiber optic solutions to support the Industrial Market. From Medical diagnostics to Broadcast communication to Oil and Gas reservoir monitoring, AFL's is uniquely positioned to enable new industrial and harsh environment communication and sensing requirements.<br />
        <h1><a href="/Markets/Industrial/Broadcast">Broadcast</a></h1>
        <div>In no other industry is the benefits of fiber optic cabling more relevant than in the Broadcast market. The growing demand for real-time programming, interactive content, and higher-resolution viewing has never been greater than today. As the technology keeps evolving, fiber optics offers broadcasters the pathways necessary for developing these new technologies. The inherent features of fiber optics such as high-bandwidth, speed of light velocity and growing reliability through cable construction have proven that fiber optic cabling and connectivity is a critical component in broadcast system design.</div>

        <p>The need for improved mobility, communications, and security are driving new requirements in the Aerospace and Defense market. Advanced guidance and control systems provide the needed improvement in positional accuracy for mobile platforms such as planes, satellites, drones, and even projectiles. The move to lighter weight composite materials demands new structural integrity measures. Victory in the military theater hinges on intelligence gathering via sensors and high speed communications. AFL's mix of fiber optic solutions support the designers of advanced gyroscopes, structural health monitoring systems, advanced tactical sensors and communications.</p>
        <h1><a href="/Markets/Industrial/Mining">Mining</a></h1>
        <p>To say that mining operations today is a challenge is an understatement. With increasing levels of governing regulations and a fluctuating market, the mining industry is constantly looking for ways to decrease operational costs while improving efficiencies and most importantly, keeping their workers safe. Communication systems for this market cannot be subpar. Mining businesses require network solutions to help reduce costs and increase productivity, while achieving or exceeding operating and financial goals.</p>
