        <p> Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> is launching the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=870BF0DCE843494FA82A4BB09B9194E4&_z=z">CGM™ Plus</a> high density rack-mount panel designed for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) applications. The panel features galvannealed steel construction with a hinged tray system that extends from the front of the panel and folds out of the way for unobstructed access. </p>
        <div>
        The CGM Plus panel can hold LGX® and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0BF61C8A34B24309B8692E67C081EF6C&_z=z">Card Guide Modules (CGM™) devices</a> interchangeably. Designed for high density applications, CGM panel-mount WDM devices are pre-terminated plug and play products built for space efficient design. Using proven thin-film filter technology, CGM devices feature low insertion loss, high isolation and superior environmental stability. Available with up to 40 DWDM channels, CGM devices can also be configured with optional express, upgrade or test ports.<br />
         <br />
        “Headend space has become increasingly congested as more and more equipment is required to meet the demands of customers,” explained Tom Jeffers, product manager for AFL. “The CGM Plus provides a high density rack-mount solution using AFL’s Card Guide Modules and the added flexibility of being backward compatible with legacy LGX products. This not only reduces space, but gives customers a seamless upgrade path toward small form factor DWDM products.”<br />
         <br />
        The CGM Plus panel is available in a 4RU height and adjustable mounting depth. Routing rings on the front of the tray provide enhanced fiber management, allowing cable assemblies to enter and exit easily. Applications include WDM, headends and central offices, telecommunications and data center.<br />

        <p> Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> is launching the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=870BF0DCE843494FA82A4BB09B9194E4&_z=z">CGM™ Plus</a> high density rack-mount panel designed for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) applications. The panel features galvannealed steel construction with a hinged tray system that extends from the front of the panel and folds out of the way for unobstructed access. </p>
        <div>
        The CGM Plus panel can hold LGX® and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0BF61C8A34B24309B8692E67C081EF6C&_z=z">Card Guide Modules (CGM™) devices</a> interchangeably. Designed for high density applications, CGM panel-mount WDM devices are pre-terminated plug and play products built for space efficient design. Using proven thin-film filter technology, CGM devices feature low insertion loss, high isolation and superior environmental stability. Available with up to 40 DWDM channels, CGM devices can also be configured with optional express, upgrade or test ports.<br />
         <br />
        “Headend space has become increasingly congested as more and more equipment is required to meet the demands of customers,” explained Tom Jeffers, product manager for AFL. “The CGM Plus provides a high density rack-mount solution using AFL’s Card Guide Modules and the added flexibility of being backward compatible with legacy LGX products. This not only reduces space, but gives customers a seamless upgrade path toward small form factor DWDM products.”<br />
         <br />
        The CGM Plus panel is available in a 4RU height and adjustable mounting depth. Routing rings on the front of the tray provide enhanced fiber management, allowing cable assemblies to enter and exit easily. Applications include WDM, headends and central offices, telecommunications and data center.<br />
