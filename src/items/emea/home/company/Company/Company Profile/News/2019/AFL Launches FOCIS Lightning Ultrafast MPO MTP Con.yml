This full view connector end face image is displayed in less than two seconds from power-on—a capability unique in the industry. Stop by booth #6120 at the<a href="https://www.ofcconference.org/en-us/home/"> OFC Conference</a>, March 5-7 in San Diego to see demonstrations. </div>
        <div>Additional key features include:  </div>
        <div> </div>
        <div>• Key up/key down polarity capture with clear fiber one identification</div>
        <div>• Support for all MPO fiber configurations, including Base-8 and Base-10</div>
        <div>• Support for up to two rows and sixteen fibers per row (32 fibers in total)</div>
        <div>• Auto-focus and auto-analysis compliant to IEC MPO standards</div>
        <div>• Ability to scroll through all individual fiber images, analysis overlays and zone tables</div>
        <div>• Bluetooth® connectivity to AFL’s free FOCIS Flex mobile app (iOS and Android)</div>
        <div> </div>
        <div>The use of advanced liquid lens optics, dual image sensors, and FPGA-based image processing make the FOCIS Lightning both small and light weight—the same size as AFL’s award-winning<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FDF30551384C4C55B6626D7D3D466816&_z=z"> FOCIS Duel</a>.</div>
        <div> </div>
        <div>“FOCIS Lightning can complete a 24-fiber MPO inspection task in less than 30 seconds, at least an order of magnitude faster than older solutions,” explained Maury Wood, senior product line manager for AFL’s Test & Inspection Division. “This level of productivity means that 100 percent connector inspection is now practical—from an OPEX perspective—in all optical network applications, including large scale enterprise and hyperscale data center build-outs and ongoing maintenance operations.”</div>
        <div> </div>
        <div>Easy-to-use Bluetooth wireless connectivity to AFL’s FOCIS Flex mobile app also provides a conduit to AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4C1A455A2E234F3A968C0A26C07049A8&_z=z">aeRos® cloud-based workflow management</a> platform, where the connector level image, zone table and pass/fail adjudication results are captured and preserved. FOCIS Lightning adapter tips support both MPO-12 and MPO-16 connector types, and both flat and angled end faces. The FOCIS Lightning is also available with a single fiber coupler, allowing this probe to complete all single fiber inspection tasks using the dozens of connector adapter tips that AFL offers.</div>

        <div>Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC –<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=CB5A0B73F40540109C53688EDA61E0F7&_z=z"> AFL </a>introduces the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=20242C1BCD984C08B5684793B2F54606&_z=z">FOCIS Lightning</a> Ultrafast MPO/MTP connector inspection system with twin 5M pixel CMOS sensors to image the entire MPO end face simultaneously and perform multi-fiber inspections 10 to 100 times faster than legacy systems. This full view connector end face image is displayed in less than two seconds from power-on—a capability unique in the industry. Stop by booth #6120 at the<a href="https://www.ofcconference.org/en-us/home/"> OFC Conference</a>, March 5-7 in San Diego to see demonstrations. </div>
        <div>Additional key features include:  </div>
        <div> </div>
        <div>• Key up/key down polarity capture with clear fiber one identification</div>
        <div>• Support for all MPO fiber configurations, including Base-8 and Base-10</div>
        <div>• Support for up to two rows and sixteen fibers per row (32 fibers in total)</div>
        <div>• Auto-focus and auto-analysis compliant to IEC MPO standards</div>
        <div>• Ability to scroll through all individual fiber images, analysis overlays and zone tables</div>
        <div>• Bluetooth® connectivity to AFL’s free FOCIS Flex mobile app (iOS and Android)</div>
        <div> </div>
        <div>The use of advanced liquid lens optics, dual image sensors, and FPGA-based image processing make the FOCIS Lightning both small and light weight—the same size as AFL’s award-winning<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FDF30551384C4C55B6626D7D3D466816&_z=z"> FOCIS Duel</a>.</div>
        <div> </div>
        <div>“FOCIS Lightning can complete a 24-fiber MPO inspection task in less than 30 seconds, at least an order of magnitude faster than older solutions,” explained Maury Wood, senior product line manager for AFL’s Test & Inspection Division. “This level of productivity means that 100 percent connector inspection is now practical—from an OPEX perspective—in all optical network applications, including large scale enterprise and hyperscale data center build-outs and ongoing maintenance operations.”</div>
        <div> </div>
        <div>Easy-to-use Bluetooth wireless connectivity to AFL’s FOCIS Flex mobile app also provides a conduit to AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4C1A455A2E234F3A968C0A26C07049A8&_z=z">aeRos® cloud-based workflow management</a> platform, where the connector level image, zone table and pass/fail adjudication results are captured and preserved. FOCIS Lightning adapter tips support both MPO-12 and MPO-16 connector types, and both flat and angled end faces. The FOCIS Lightning is also available with a single fiber coupler, allowing this probe to complete all single fiber inspection tasks using the dozens of connector adapter tips that AFL offers.</div>
        <div> </div>
        <div>FOCIS Lightning recently won <a href="https://www.bicsi.org/conferences-and-events/bicsi-events/conferences-exhibitions/2019-winter-conferences/attendees/new-product-pavilion">“Best in Show” </a>at the 2019 BICSI Winter Conference & Exhibition, and was rated <a href="https://www.lightwaveonline.com/articles/2019-lightwave-innovation-reviews/afl-focis-lightning.html">“superb”</a> by the 2019 Lightwave Innovation Reviews.</div>
        <div> </div>
        <div>FOCIS Lightning is available for order in a variety of kit bundles by March 2019. View AFL’s complete line of inspection systems and all of AFL’s other products and services at <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.</div>
