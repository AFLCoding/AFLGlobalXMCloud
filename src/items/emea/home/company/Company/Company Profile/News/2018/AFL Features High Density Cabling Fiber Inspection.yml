        “At AFL we strive for continuous innovation in products, technologies and services,” explained Kevin Clayton, service provider market manager for AFL. “Our purpose is to provide efficient end-to-end solutions for everyone constructing networks and industrious support for those who maintain infrastructure.” <br />
         <br />
        High Density Cable<br />
        AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E3EB3C385CF74B19A8E4B4564B608857&_z=z">OSP MicroCore</a> integrates the latest technology, 200 μm buffered single-mode fiber, allowing for reduced diameter cables (as compared to traditional OSP micro-cables). Available from 24 to 432 fibers, the cable consists of a multi-fiber-set, gel-filled buffer tube construction. With the low-friction, high-strength overall jacketing system, the cable core is protected and supports high-speed, long-distance jetting performance.<br />
         <br />
        <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Wrapping-Tube-Cable/Wrapping-Tube-Cable-(WTC)-with-SWR.aspx?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTmpjeU1qSmtNR1ZrWXpreiIsInQiOiI3RnBWczdDV2tKeWNkZEpRWTEwcmx1QzhNUUJVZk1waUZ4XC9WcFpVMEU2UFU5cmdDd2RpWkdGVHg5TklMbFpuZ0srVEhyOGlcL2VtQnBcL2J4aUdLZmdPUT09In0%3D">Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC) with SpiderWeb Ribbon® </a>is an ultra-high density outside plant cable ideal for data center inter-building connections, Campus LAN, access provider metro rings and more. WTC with SpiderWeb Ribbon provides the smallest cable diameter and lowest weight, high fiber count ribbon cable in the industry and is available with 144 fibers to 1,728 armored and up to 3,456 fibers in non-armored configuration.<br />
         <br />
        Test & Inspection<br />
        FOCIS Duel is a fiber inspection probe with two optical ports, one optimized for fast subjective patch cord end-face inspection, with the second port supporting all the comprehensive features of AFL’s FOCIS Flex inspection system. FOCIS Duel has no moving parts and requires no operator adjustments to deliver fast automatic image analysis to industry standards and custom criteria. Linked wirelessly to AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4C1A455A2E234F3A968C0A26C07049A8&_z=z">aeRos® cloud-based work flow management platform</a>, FOCIS Duel is a complete solution.<br />
         <br />
        FOCIS WiFi2 Fiber Inspection System uses an Android or iOS wireless connection for live image video streaming, auto-focus and more. The FOCIS WiFi2 probe is ergonomic and lightweight, fitting perfectly and balancing naturally in the hand. <br />
         <br />
        Compact Enclosures<br />
        AFL’s LightLink LL-550 Optical Splicing and Distribution Enclosure is a compact wall-mounted enclosure that provides for organizing, splicing and interconnecting fibers. This enclosure is ideal for business service hand-offs, MDU distribution and connectivity, cellular backhaul and other commercial services that require weather-proof field connectivity, but may have size constraints. The LL-550 is available with up to 48 SC UPC or APC connections as well as a splice-only configuration for up to 144 single fusion splices or 576 ribbon fibers with mass fusion.<br />

        High Density Cable<br />
        AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E3EB3C385CF74B19A8E4B4564B608857&_z=z">OSP MicroCore</a> integrates the latest technology, 200 μm buffered single-mode fiber, allowing for reduced diameter cables (as compared to traditional OSP micro-cables). Available from 24 to 432 fibers, the cable consists of a multi-fiber-set, gel-filled buffer tube construction. With the low-friction, high-strength overall jacketing system, the cable core is protected and supports high-speed, long-distance jetting performance.<br />
         <br />

WTC with SpiderWeb Ribbon provides the smallest cable diameter and lowest weight, high fiber count ribbon cable in the industry and is available with 144 fibers to 1,728 armored and up to 3,456 fibers in non-armored configuration.<br />
         <br />
        Test & Inspection<br />
        FOCIS Duel is a fiber inspection probe with two optical ports, one optimized for fast subjective patch cord end-face inspection, with the second port supporting all the comprehensive features of AFL’s FOCIS Flex inspection system. FOCIS Duel has no moving parts and requires no operator adjustments to deliver fast automatic image analysis to industry standards and custom criteria. Linked wirelessly to AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4C1A455A2E234F3A968C0A26C07049A8&_z=z">aeRos® cloud-based work flow management platform</a>, FOCIS Duel is a complete solution.<br />
         <br />
        FOCIS WiFi2 Fiber Inspection System uses an Android or iOS wireless connection for live image video streaming, auto-focus and more. The FOCIS WiFi2 probe is ergonomic and lightweight, fitting perfectly and balancing naturally in the hand. <br />
         <br />
        Compact Enclosures<br />
        AFL’s LightLink LL-550 Optical Splicing and Distribution Enclosure is a compact wall-mounted enclosure that provides for organizing, splicing and interconnecting fibers. This enclosure is ideal for business service hand-offs, MDU distribution and connectivity, cellular backhaul and other commercial services that require weather-proof field connectivity, but may have size constraints. The LL-550 is available with up to 48 SC UPC or APC connections as well as a splice-only configuration for up to 144 single fusion splices or 576 ribbon fibers with mass fusion.<br />
