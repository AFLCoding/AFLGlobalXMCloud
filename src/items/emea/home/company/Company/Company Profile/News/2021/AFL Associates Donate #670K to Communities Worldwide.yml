        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a global manufacturer and provider of services, held its fifth annual <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E4E2803881E7472E8F43A3451FDD6B90&_z=z">Imagine That! fundraising campaign</a>, supporting communities worldwide in areas where AFL has operations. This year’s campaign, themed Global Games—Give for the Gold, finished with a $670,000 donation to organizations around the world including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.<br />
        src="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/AFL_UW_670000_2a.aspx?width=598&height=413" title="AFL Associates Donate $670K Worldwide" style="height: 413px; width: 598px; border: 0px;" /><br />
         <br />
        All AFL locations participated in the campaign by encouraging associates to consider financially contributing to their community. All donations were matched dollar for dollar up to $100 by AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>. While many campaigns were held virtually due to the pandemic, results topped the previous year’s campaign when associates were 100 percent virtual. Compared to 2020, AFL associates increased their financial contribution by 36 percent and the number of donors increased by 27%.<br />
         <br />
        Within the United States, AFL partners with local United Way chapters to host this campaign. Internationally, AFL campaign leads select organizations that associates know well. This year, international recipients included:<br />
         <br />
        <ul>
            <li>Breakfast Club of Canada</li>
            <li>Caritas and Amigos de la Sierra (Mexico)</li>
            <li>Prospect Hospice, Headway Swindon, Wiltshire Air Ambulance, Threshold Housing Link, and Swindon and Gloucestershire Mind (Swindon, UK)</li>
            <li>Willen Hospice, YMCA, Medical Detection Dogs (Milton Keynes, UK)</li>
            <li>Reha Verein (Germany)</li>
            <li>Alannah & Madeline Foundation, Yalari and Feel the Magic (Australia/New Zealand)</li>
        </ul>
         <br />
        AFL’s Monterrey location yielded the greatest number of associates participating in the campaign. AFL’s Monroe, North Carolina location realized the greatest increase in financial contribution of 123%.<br />
         <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more.

        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a global manufacturer and provider of services, held its fifth annual&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E4E2803881E7472E8F43A3451FDD6B90&amp;_z=z">Imagine That! fundraising campaign</a>, supporting communities worldwide in areas where AFL has operations. This year&rsquo;s campaign, themed Global Games&mdash;Give for the Gold, finished with a $670,000 donation to organizations around the world including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.<br />

        &nbsp;<br />
        All AFL locations participated in the campaign by encouraging associates to consider financially contributing to their community. All donations were matched dollar for dollar up to $100 by AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&amp;_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>. While many campaigns were held virtually due to the pandemic, results topped the previous year&rsquo;s campaign when associates were 100 percent virtual. Compared to 2020, AFL associates increased their financial contribution by 36 percent and the number of donors increased by 27%.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        Within the United States, AFL partners with local United Way chapters to host this campaign. Internationally, AFL campaign leads select organizations that associates know well. This year, international recipients included:<br />
