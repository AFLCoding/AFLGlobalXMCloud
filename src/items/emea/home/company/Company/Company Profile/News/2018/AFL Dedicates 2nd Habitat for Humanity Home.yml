        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading fiber optic manufacturer and provider of services, and <a href="http://www.habitatspartanburg.org/">Habitat for Humanity of Spartanburg</a>, joined with Crystal Thompson and her family to dedicate their new home January 12. The house was sponsored by AFL through its Community Outreach Program and mostly built by AFL volunteers, friends and family.<br />
        <br />
        “Seeing the results of months of effort by so many volunteers is very rewarding,” commented Corie Culp, community outreach manager for AFL. “Not only have we—AFL volunteers plus additional community members—helped build this house, but we’ve help provide a home for a family in our community.”<br />
        <br />
        More than 250 AFL volunteers helped build the house starting with the wall-raising ceremony held September 5, 2017 and continuing through early December. From framing and installation of siding and drywall to setting cabinets and landscaping, volunteers worked diligently to complete the home for the Thompsons. This is the second Habitat for Humanity house AFL associates have built.<br />
        <br />
        “Habitat Spartanburg is enormously grateful for AFL’s support,” said Lee Close, executive director of Spartanburg Habitat for Humanity. “Spartanburg is fortunate to have such a generous company in the county footprint, but AFL has also been supportive of Habitat efforts across the region. When we talk about true community spirit, AFL is a company that believes in giving back—not only financially, but through volunteerism. That is genuine leadership driven by compassion for others.”<br />
        <br />
        Habitat for Humanity has built 127 homes across Spartanburg County with the Thompson’s home being the 14th house in the Habitat at Regional neighborhood. Three more houses are currently being built.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.habitat.org/">Habitat for Humanity</a> envisions a world where everyone has a decent place to live. Families are selected for the program based on need, income and willingness to partner with Habitat. After completing financial counseling and 350 hours of “sweat equity,” Habitat homeowners receive affordable mortgages with monthly payments averaging $400. In Spartanburg, Habitat offers homeowners and their neighbors’ social services including health screenings, counseling and job fairs.<br />

        AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> provides grants, sponsorships, volunteer outreach, disaster relief and more.

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading fiber optic manufacturer and provider of services, and <a href="http://www.habitatspartanburg.org/">Habitat for Humanity of Spartanburg</a>, joined with Crystal Thompson and her family to dedicate their new home January 12. The house was sponsored by AFL through its Community Outreach Program and mostly built by AFL volunteers, friends and family.<br />
        <br />
        “Seeing the results of months of effort by so many volunteers is very rewarding,” commented Corie Culp, community outreach manager for AFL. “Not only have we—AFL volunteers plus additional community members—helped build this house, but we’ve help provide a home for a family in our community.”<br />
        <br />
        More than 250 AFL volunteers helped build the house starting with the wall-raising ceremony held September 5, 2017 and continuing through early December. From framing and installation of siding and drywall to setting cabinets and landscaping, volunteers worked diligently to complete the home for the Thompsons. This is the second Habitat for Humanity house AFL associates have built.<br />
        <br />
        “Habitat Spartanburg is enormously grateful for AFL’s support,” said Lee Close, executive director of Spartanburg Habitat for Humanity. “Spartanburg is fortunate to have such a generous company in the county footprint, but AFL has also been supportive of Habitat efforts across the region. When we talk about true community spirit, AFL is a company that believes in giving back—not only financially, but through volunteerism. That is genuine leadership driven by compassion for others.”<br />
        <br />
        Habitat for Humanity has built 127 homes across Spartanburg County with the Thompson’s home being the 14th house in the Habitat at Regional neighborhood. Three more houses are currently being built.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.habitat.org/">Habitat for Humanity</a> envisions a world where everyone has a decent place to live. Families are selected for the program based on need, income and willingness to partner with Habitat. After completing financial counseling and 350 hours of “sweat equity,” Habitat homeowners receive affordable mortgages with monthly payments averaging $400. In Spartanburg, Habitat offers homeowners and their neighbors’ social services including health screenings, counseling and job fairs.<br />
