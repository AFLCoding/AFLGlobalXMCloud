        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, announces it has entered into a multi-year partnership with the <a href="https://www.greenvilletriumph.com/">Greenville Triumph</a>, the Upstate’s own United Soccer League (USL) League One team. The partnership includes a co-branded initiative called the "Pass It On Program" which will provide mentoring to underserved and disadvantaged youth players in the Upstate community.<br />
        “Partnering with the Greenville Triumph allows us to continue our investment in the Upstate and strengthen our commitment to Community Engagement,” explained Jody Gallagher, President and CEO of AFL. “AFL and the Greenville Triumph have a common objective—to engage youth by providing opportunities for their immediate and long-term development. Through the 'Pass It On Program,' youth in the Upstate will have a chance to learn and grow in a positive environment with mentors by their side.”<br />
        <br />
        The "Pass It On Program" is a 60-minute program session that provides participants the opportunity to learn about nutrition, physical activity and life skills in a safe, stress-free environment. Additionally, children will learn about teamwork while working on soccer skills, and at the end of the program, they will participate in a scrimmage. The program will begin May 2021 and will be held once per month, ending September 2021 during the first season. AFL is providing scholarships to be used to support eligible players who would like to attend the Triumph camps and clinics. <br />
        <br />
        Greenville Triumph SC plays its first match as the defending title-winners against the Richmond Kickers at City Stadium on Saturday, April 24. During the league's first full month of action, Greenville will host a matchup between the league’s first two title-winners when North Texas comes to Triumph Stadium on May 1. <br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, announces it has entered into a multi-year partnership with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.greenvilletriumph.com/">Greenville Triumph</a>, the Upstate&rsquo;s own United Soccer League (USL) League One team. The partnership includes a co-branded initiative called the "Pass It On Program" which will provide mentoring to underserved and disadvantaged youth players in the Upstate community.<br />
        &ldquo;Partnering with the Greenville Triumph allows us to continue our investment in the Upstate and strengthen our commitment to Community Engagement,&rdquo; explained Jody Gallagher, President and CEO of AFL. &ldquo;AFL and the Greenville Triumph have a common objective&mdash;to engage youth by providing opportunities for their immediate and long-term development. Through the 'Pass It On Program,' youth in the Upstate will have a chance to learn and grow in a positive environment with mentors by their side.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        The "Pass It On Program" is a 60-minute program session that provides participants the opportunity to learn about nutrition, physical activity and life skills in a safe, stress-free environment. Additionally, children will learn about teamwork while working on soccer skills, and at the end of the program, they will participate in a scrimmage. The program will begin May 2021 and will be held once per month, ending September 2021 during the first season. AFL is providing scholarships to be used to support eligible&nbsp;players who would like to attend the Triumph&nbsp;camps and clinics.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Greenville Triumph SC plays its first match as the defending title-winners against the Richmond Kickers at City Stadium on Saturday, April 24. During&nbsp;the league's first full month of action, Greenville will host a matchup&nbsp;between the league&rsquo;s first two title-winners when North Texas comes to Triumph Stadium on May 1.&nbsp;<br />
