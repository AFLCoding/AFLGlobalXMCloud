        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading fiber optic manufacturer and provider of services, was the recipient of the 2017 Middle Tyger Community Impact Award presented by the <a href="http://www.spartanburgymca.org/">YMCA of Greater Spartanburg</a>. The award is given to individuals and organizations that demonstrate extraordinary commitment and support of the YMCA’s mission, to put Christian principles into practice through programs that create a healthy spirit, mind and body for all. The award is decided upon by the YMCA staff and board leaders.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/MT-YMCA3.aspx" target="_blank"></a>“AFL was chosen because of their generous support of our mission through the annual campaign as well their support of a wide array of local charitable initiatives,” commented Rick Callebs, CEO of the YMCA of Greater Spartanburg. “Moreover, AFL has given more over time to the Middle Tyger YMCA in terms of annual dollars and volunteer service than any other organization in the Middle Tyger service area.”<br />
         <br />
        For nearly 10 years, AFL has supported the <a href="http://www.spartanburgymca.org/middle-tyger-ymca.php">Middle Tyger YMCA</a> and its Partners with Youth Scholarship Program. With the diverse community that the YMCA serves, the ability to pay for a membership or childcare services can be a hindrance for many families. The YMCA vows to never turn anyone away for that reason. Funding from AFL helped provide financial assistance to those in the community who need support during times when unforeseen circumstances make it difficult to afford services at the YMCA.<br />
         <br />
        “We are honored to be chosen as a recipient of the 2017 Middle Tyger Community Impact Award,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “AFL and its associates live out our core value—community engagement. We believe in giving back not only financially but also with our time. Putting forth these efforts help enable others to thrive now and for years to come.”<br />
         <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants, sponsorships, volunteer projects, disaster relief and more.

        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/MT-YMCA3.aspx" target="_blank"></a>“AFL was chosen because of their generous support of our mission through the annual campaign as well their support of a wide array of local charitable initiatives,” commented Rick Callebs, CEO of the YMCA of Greater Spartanburg. “Moreover, AFL has given more over time to the Middle Tyger YMCA in terms of annual dollars and volunteer service than any other organization in the Middle Tyger service area.”<br />
         <br />
        For nearly 10 years, AFL has supported the <a href="http://www.spartanburgymca.org/middle-tyger-ymca.php">Middle Tyger YMCA</a> and its Partners with Youth Scholarship Program. With the diverse community that the YMCA serves, the ability to pay for a membership or childcare services can be a hindrance for many families. The YMCA vows to never turn anyone away for that reason. Funding from AFL helped provide financial assistance to those in the community who need support during times when unforeseen circumstances make it difficult to afford services at the YMCA.<br />
         <br />
        “We are honored to be chosen as a recipient of the 2017 Middle Tyger Community Impact Award,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “AFL and its associates live out our core value—community engagement. We believe in giving back not only financially but also with our time. Putting forth these efforts help enable others to thrive now and for years to come.”<br />
