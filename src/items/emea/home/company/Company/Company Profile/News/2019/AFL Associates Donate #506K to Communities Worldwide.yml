        <div>Spartanburg, SC – June 24, 2019 – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a global manufacturer and provider of services, held its third annual <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E4E2803881E7472E8F43A3451FDD6B90&_z=z">Imagine That! fundraising campaign</a>, supporting communities worldwide in areas where AFL has operations. This year’s campaign increased by ­44 percent over last year, generating $506K to organizations around the world including in the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico and New Zealand.
        <br />
        “This year’s results are phenomenal and will greatly impact organizations in our communities, ultimately helping children and families thrive,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Our associates’ passion for others is evident in how much they gave back to make a difference in the lives of others.”<br />
         <br />
        This year’s campaign theme was titled, “Game On!” and provided an interactive element of gaming including references to Pac-Man, Candy Crush, Mario and more. Associates learned more about the need in their respective communities and were given the opportunity to donate. AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> matched all donations up to $100.<br />
         <br />
        AFL US locations in South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Washington supported local United Way organizations and generated $474,000. AFL locations internationally also supported the annual campaign, donating to various local organizations chosen by associates, and increased the financial impact to $506K.<br />
        <br />
        AFL has an extensive Community Outreach Program that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more. For additional information on AFL and its community initiatives, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
