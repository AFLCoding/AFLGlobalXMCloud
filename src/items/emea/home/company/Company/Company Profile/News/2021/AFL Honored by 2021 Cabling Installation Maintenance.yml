        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and accessories, has been recognized among the best by the 2021 <a href="https://www.cablinginstall.com/">Cabling Installation & Maintenance</a> (CI&M) Innovators Awards. AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BD16F0851A334911A1C25E3194A9D166&_z=z">Apex® splice closure</a> received a platinum-level honoree status, the highest achievable, and the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2E8A1E84DF684525BB00EFB67133746A&_z=z">Fujikura 90R mass fusion splicer</a> received a gold-level honoree status. Recognition came from an esteemed and experienced panel of judges from the cabling community.<br />
        <br />
        “We are honored to receive this recognition from the CI&M panel. This reinforces the fact that we are creating innovative technologies and exceptional products that support the ever-changing and growing markets we serve,” explained Kurt Dallas, President of AFL Product Solutions. “We are committed to listening to our customers and developing unique solutions that drive bottom-line results.”<br />
        <br />
        Apex splice closures are designed to lower overall installation time with easier-to-use sealing and cable retention methods. With a wedge-based gel sealing system, installation time is drastically decreased as network reliability increases. The Apex X-2 and X-2S splice closure sizes have maximum capacities of 1,728 and 3,456 fibers, respectively, when using 200 µm SpiderWeb Ribbon®.<br />
        <br />
        The Fujikura 90R mass fusion splicer is the answer to higher density applications where single fiber splicing is too costly and timely. With automated splice start, tube heater, cleave tracking, and blade rotations for up to two cleavers at a time, the 90R splicer frees up operator time for other fiber preparation steps. Additionally, with field replaceable V-grooves, this splicer can be kept in the field longer by using the spare set.<br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and accessories, has been recognized among the best by the 2021&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cablinginstall.com/">Cabling Installation &amp; Maintenance</a>&nbsp;(CI&amp;M) Innovators Awards. AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BD16F0851A334911A1C25E3194A9D166&amp;_z=z">Apex&reg; splice closure</a>&nbsp;received a platinum-level honoree status, the highest achievable, and the&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2E8A1E84DF684525BB00EFB67133746A&amp;_z=z">Fujikura 90R mass fusion splicer</a>&nbsp;received a gold-level honoree status. Recognition came from an esteemed and experienced panel of judges from the cabling community.<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;We are honored to receive this recognition from the CI&amp;M panel. This reinforces the fact that we are creating innovative technologies and exceptional products that support the ever-changing and growing markets we serve,&rdquo; explained Kurt Dallas, President of AFL Product Solutions. &ldquo;We are committed to listening to our customers and developing unique solutions that drive bottom-line results.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        Apex splice closures&nbsp;are designed to lower overall installation time with easier-to-use sealing and cable retention methods. With a wedge-based gel sealing system, installation time is drastically decreased as network reliability increases. The Apex X-2 and X-2S splice closure sizes have maximum capacities of 1,728 and 3,456 fibers, respectively, when using 200 &micro;m SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg;.<br />
        <br />
        The&nbsp;Fujikura 90R mass fusion splicer&nbsp;is the answer to higher density applications where single fiber splicing is too costly and timely. With automated splice start, tube heater, cleave tracking, and blade rotations for up to two cleavers at a time, the 90R splicer frees up operator time for other fiber preparation steps. Additionally, with field replaceable V-grooves, this splicer can be kept in the field longer by using the spare set.<br />
