        <div style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;">Westford, MA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic system solutions, was honored with 4.5 Diamonds from the Diamond Technology Reviews for its <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=20242C1BCD984C08B5684793B2F54606&_z=z">FOCIS Lightning Multi-Fiber Connector Inspection System</a>, and 4.0 Diamonds for its <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=20E2F58A53B248A9A34F015E30F17C8B&_z=z">FlexScan® Quad OTDR</a>. The Diamond Technology Reviews, now in its fifteenth year, are awarded by <a href="https://www.broadbandtechreport.com/index.html" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">Broadband Technology Report</a> to recognize innovation in technology serving the broadband cable industry.<br />
        “AFL is extremely honored to once again be recognized for our innovation with fiber inspection systems and OTDRs,” stated Michael Scholten, senior product line manager for AFL. “Service providers and their contract installers are struggling to deploy and verify fiber fast enough to meet business and consumers bandwidth demand. The pocket-sized FOCIS Lightning MPO Connector Inspection probe and FlexScan Quad OTDR reduce test time, simplify setup and present easily understood results, enabling both novice and expert technicians to successfully verify and troubleshoot optical networks faster and more accurately, eliminating time-consuming follow-up visits to correct unresolved issues.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s FOCIS Lightning is an ultrafast compact multi-fiber inspection system that is 10 to 100 times faster than other solutions. It can capture, display and analyze the entire MPO connector end-face with just a push of a button. FOCIS Lightning can store up to 10,000 images and results can be easily shared via USB, WiFi or Bluetooth for reporting and archiving. Learn more about FOCIS Lightning by <a href="https://youtu.be/i6h2do8a3xc" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">viewing our video here</a>.<br />
        <br />
        The FlexScan Quad OTDR enables both expert and novice technicians to quickly detect, identify and measure optical network components and faults. After applying industry-standard or user-set pass/fail criteria, the unit displays the network using intuitive LinkMap color-coded icons. The FS300-325 is an all-in-one solution with integrated optical light source, power meter, VFL and optional connector inspection. Results can be printed to PDF and stored internally or externally, or professional reports can be generated using the included Windows-compatible <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A335B3378E7E49E5994B65B97A637C44&_z=z">TRM® 3.0 Test Results Manager software</a>.<br />
        <br />
        The Diamond Technology Reviews were developed to recognize some of the top products and solutions available to the cable industry as determined by a stellar panel of cable telecommunications engineering experts. Award classification, from 0-5, is based on the impact the product has on designers, systems integrators, and/or end users with 4.0-4.5 representing an “excellent product with technical features and performance that provide clear and substantial benefits”, according to BTR’s website.<br />
