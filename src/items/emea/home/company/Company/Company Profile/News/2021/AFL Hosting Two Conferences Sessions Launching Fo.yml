        On Wednesday, March 3, from 12:00 p.m. – 1:00 p.m. Eastern, learn more about how ribbon fiber is used in today’s advanced infrastructure, making installations and repairs quicker and less costly. The conference session titled, “If You Thought Ribbon Was for Data Centers Only—Think Again!” is free to BICSI attendees. <a href="https://www.bicsi.org/conferences-and-events/bicsi-events/conferences-exhibitions/2021-winter-conference-exhibition/attendee-registration">Register here</a>.<br />

        AFL will be introducing four new products during the show. Launched December 2020, the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Splice-Closures/Apex-Fiber-Optic-Splice-Closures.aspx">Apex™ family of fiber optic splice closures</a> is designed to lower overall installation time with easier to use sealing and cable retention methods, along with industry-leading density, especially when coupled with AFL’s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/High-Density/OSP-MicroCore/LM-Series-OSP-MicroCore-Blown-Fiber-Cables.aspx">LM-series MicroCore®</a> cable or <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/High-Density/Wrapping-Tube-Cable.aspx">Wrapping Tube Cable powered by SpiderWeb Ribbon®</a>. The initial launch of Apex splice closures includes the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Splice-Closures/Apex-Fiber-Optic-Splice-Closures/Apex-X-2-Sealed-Splice-Closure.aspx">X-2</a> and <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Splice-Closures/Apex-Fiber-Optic-Splice-Closures/Apex-X-2S-Sealed-Splice-Closure.aspx">X-2S</a> models which have maximum capacities of 1,728 and 3,456 fibers, respectively, when using 200 µm SpiderWeb Ribbon.<br />
        <br />
        AFL expanded its ASCEND modular platform, adding <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Rack-Mount-Patch-Panels/ASCEND-High-Density-Platform/ASCEND-Conversion-Cassettes.aspx">conversion</a> and <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Rack-Mount-Patch-Panels/ASCEND-High-Density-Platform/ASCEND-Tap-Cassettes.aspx">tap cassettes</a> to its high-density solution. The <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/product-connectivity-ascend">ASCEND high density solution</a> meets the growing demand for bandwidth and features fiber housings, high-density optical cassettes, custom trunk cable assemblies and field-reversible patch cords. AFL’s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Rack-Mount-Patch-Panels/ASCEND-High-Density-Platform/ASCEND-Conversion-Cassettes.aspx">Conversion Cassettes</a> provide a seamless transition from one BASE platform to another while the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Rack-Mount-Patch-Panels/ASCEND-High-Density-Platform/ASCEND-Tap-Cassettes.aspx">Tap Cassettes</a> enable access points for monitoring live traffic signals.<br />
        <br />
        The third new product introduction is AFL’s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Identification/Visual-Fault-Identifiers/vfis.aspx">VFI4 Visual Fault Locator</a>, an essential troubleshooting tool for fiber installation and maintenance technicians. This compact unit injects a high-powered visible laser light that provides exceptional brightness and range for locating defects in single-mode and multimode fibers.<br />
         <br />
        Lastly, AFL will introduce the next-gen <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/news/afl-introduces-next-gen-fuseconnect-mpo-splice-on-connector">FUSEConnect MPO</a>. This connector features an updated design that migrates from a mechanical splice protection clamp to a heat-shrink splice protection sleeve that is applied with the standard on-board splicer heater oven, eliminating the need for a separate mechanical clamp tool. Designed to utilize standard ribbon, <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/SpiderWeb-Ribbon-(SWR-).aspx">SpiderWeb Ribbon®</a>, or loose tube cable, this connector helps minimize the complexity involved in the termination of multi-fiber connectors.<br />

        AFL will be introducing four new products during the show. Launched December 2020, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Splice-Closures/Apex-Fiber-Optic-Splice-Closures.aspx">Apex&trade; family of fiber optic splice closures</a>&nbsp;is designed to lower overall installation time with easier to use sealing and cable retention methods, along with industry-leading density, especially when coupled with AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/High-Density/OSP-MicroCore/LM-Series-OSP-MicroCore-Blown-Fiber-Cables.aspx">LM-series MicroCore&reg;</a>&nbsp;cable or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/High-Density/Wrapping-Tube-Cable.aspx">Wrapping Tube Cable powered by SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg;</a>. The initial launch of Apex splice closures includes the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Splice-Closures/Apex-Fiber-Optic-Splice-Closures/Apex-X-2-Sealed-Splice-Closure.aspx">X-2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Splice-Closures/Apex-Fiber-Optic-Splice-Closures/Apex-X-2S-Sealed-Splice-Closure.aspx">X-2S</a>&nbsp;models which have maximum capacities of 1,728 and 3,456 fibers, respectively, when using 200 &micro;m SpiderWeb Ribbon.<br />
        <br />
        AFL expanded its ASCEND modular platform, adding&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Rack-Mount-Patch-Panels/ASCEND-High-Density-Platform/ASCEND-Conversion-Cassettes.aspx">conversion</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Rack-Mount-Patch-Panels/ASCEND-High-Density-Platform/ASCEND-Tap-Cassettes.aspx">tap cassettes</a>&nbsp;to its high-density solution. The&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/product-connectivity-ascend">ASCEND high density solution</a>&nbsp;meets the growing demand for bandwidth and features fiber housings, high-density optical cassettes, custom trunk cable assemblies and field-reversible patch cords. AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Rack-Mount-Patch-Panels/ASCEND-High-Density-Platform/ASCEND-Conversion-Cassettes.aspx">Conversion Cassettes</a>&nbsp;provide a seamless transition from one BASE platform to another while the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Rack-Mount-Patch-Panels/ASCEND-High-Density-Platform/ASCEND-Tap-Cassettes.aspx">Tap Cassettes</a>&nbsp;enable access points for monitoring live traffic signals.<br />
        <br />
        The third new product introduction is AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Identification/Visual-Fault-Identifiers/vfis.aspx">VFI4 Visual Fault Locator</a>, an essential troubleshooting tool for fiber installation and maintenance technicians. This compact unit injects a high-powered visible laser light that provides exceptional brightness and range for locating defects in single-mode and multimode fibers.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        Lastly, AFL will introduce the next-gen&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/news/afl-introduces-next-gen-fuseconnect-mpo-splice-on-connector">FUSEConnect MPO</a>. This connector features an updated design that migrates from a mechanical splice protection clamp to a heat-shrink splice protection sleeve that is applied with the standard on-board splicer heater oven, eliminating the need for a separate mechanical clamp tool. Designed to utilize standard ribbon,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/SpiderWeb-Ribbon-(SWR-).aspx">SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg;</a>, or loose tube cable, this connector helps minimize the complexity involved in the termination of multi-fiber connectors.<br />
