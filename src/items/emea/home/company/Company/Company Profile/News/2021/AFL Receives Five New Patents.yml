        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, was awarded five new patents over the past quarter for technology and developments in <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&_z=z">connectivity</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E545E2A90D414F31BDD0BA9B8ED27FD0&_z=z">fiber optic cable</a>.<br />
        <br />
        Four patents were received for connectivity, two of which coincide with AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DB44898475AB4B0B9D36E60964EFD850&_z=z">ASCEND® high-density platform</a>. The first invention is for the ASCEND high density patch panel with modular cassettes. These panels can be deployed in a chassis system with extendable drawers to facilitate moves, adds and changes within a connected network. The second invention is for a splice cassette that includes a splice holder that supports single and mass splices using the same components. This Poli-MOD splice cassette fits in locations where other ASCEND cassettes fit without requiring changes.<br />
        <br />
        The next patent is for AFL’s NodeFLEX™ Bendable Cable Assemblies. The assembly’s fitting includes a flexible boot with integrated steel wires that allow installers to flex and hold the fitting at any angle up to 90° depending on the cable installation requirements. The fourth patent is for optical fiber trunk cable breakout canisters and assemblies in which the canister is designed to use like parts and provide ease of manufacturing.<br />
        <br />
        Lastly, AFL received a patent for reduced-diameter composite downhole logging cables that contain both copper and fiber components. The design is smaller, lightweight and a more flexible alternative to traditional downhole cables.<br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories,&nbsp;was awarded five new patents over the past quarter for technology and developments in&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&amp;_z=z">connectivity</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E545E2A90D414F31BDD0BA9B8ED27FD0&amp;_z=z">fiber optic cable</a>.<br />
        <br />
        Four patents were received for connectivity, two of which coincide with AFL&rsquo;s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DB44898475AB4B0B9D36E60964EFD850&amp;_z=z">ASCEND&reg; high-density platform</a>. The first invention is for the ASCEND high density patch panel with modular cassettes. These panels can be deployed in a chassis system with extendable drawers to facilitate moves, adds and changes within a connected network. The second invention is for a splice cassette that includes a splice holder that supports single and mass splices using the same components. This Poli-MOD splice cassette fits in locations where other ASCEND cassettes fit without requiring changes.<br />
        <br />
        The next patent is for AFL&rsquo;s NodeFLEX&trade; Bendable Cable Assemblies. The assembly&rsquo;s fitting includes a flexible boot with integrated steel wires that allow installers to flex and hold the fitting at any angle up to 90&deg; depending on the cable installation requirements. The fourth patent is for optical fiber trunk cable breakout canisters and assemblies in which the canister is designed to use like parts and provide ease of manufacturing.<br />
        <br />
        Lastly, AFL received a patent for reduced-diameter composite downhole logging cables that contain both copper and fiber components. The design is smaller, lightweight and a more flexible alternative to traditional downhole cables.<br />
