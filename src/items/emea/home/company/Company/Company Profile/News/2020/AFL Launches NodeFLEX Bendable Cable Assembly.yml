        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, introduces the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2BD76218DAB8421198B46DEE80C7B35E&_z=z">NodeFLEX cable assembly</a>, a universal, flexible node cable assembly that features a bendable rubber boot with integrated steel rods which hold the cable in place up to 90° after flexing. This feature allows a single product to cover both aerial and below-grade or pedestal applications.<br />
        <br />

         <br />
        “Bandwidth needs continue to rise, especially in our current global climate where working from home has become the ‘new normal’,” explained Will Miller, senior product manager for AFL’s Outside Plant Cable and Connectivity products. “Because the NodeFLEX cable assembly is the only product needed to service aerial and below-grade installations, MSOs utilizing hybrid fiber-coax networks can accelerate their node+0 and fiber deep deployments.”<br />
         <br />
        The NodeFLEX cable assembly is available in armored or dielectric cable up to 24 fibers. Multiple connector variations and furcation options are available. In addition to the 90° bend, the 5/8”-24 UNEF fitting is IP68-rated for submersion in up to three meters of water for up to 72 hours, ensuring long-term reliability of below-grade installations.<br />
         <br />
        Miller continued, “This allows network engineers, procurement and logistics personnel at these service providers to manage half the amount of part numbers. Additionally, technicians utilizing these products in the field have more flexibility to what is stocked in their trucks, requiring less trips back to the warehouse between work orders.”<br />
         <br />
        The NodeFLEX cable assembly is a new addition to AFL’s comprehensive line of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&_z=z">fiber connectivity</a> products including hardened pre-terminated multiport terminals and drops, fiber distribution hubs, closures, field installable connectors, and more. For additional information about AFL, its products and services, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, introduces the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2BD76218DAB8421198B46DEE80C7B35E&_z=z">NodeFLEX cable assembly</a>, a universal, flexible node cable assembly that features a bendable rubber boot with integrated steel rods which hold the cable in place up to 90° after flexing. This feature allows a single product to cover both aerial and below-grade or pedestal applications.<br />

        “Bandwidth needs continue to rise, especially in our current global climate where working from home has become the ‘new normal’,” explained Will Miller, senior product manager for AFL’s Outside Plant Cable and Connectivity products. “Because the NodeFLEX cable assembly is the only product needed to service aerial and below-grade installations, MSOs utilizing hybrid fiber-coax networks can accelerate their node+0 and fiber deep deployments.”<br />
         <br />
        The NodeFLEX cable assembly is available in armored or dielectric cable up to 24 fibers. Multiple connector variations and furcation options are available. In addition to the 90° bend, the 5/8”-24 UNEF fitting is IP68-rated for submersion in up to three meters of water for up to 72 hours, ensuring long-term reliability of below-grade installations.<br />
         <br />
        Miller continued, “This allows network engineers, procurement and logistics personnel at these service providers to manage half the amount of part numbers. Additionally, technicians utilizing these products in the field have more flexibility to what is stocked in their trucks, requiring less trips back to the warehouse between work orders.”<br />
         <br />
        The NodeFLEX cable assembly is a new addition to AFL’s comprehensive line of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&_z=z">fiber connectivity</a> products including hardened pre-terminated multiport terminals and drops, fiber distribution hubs, closures, field installable connectors, and more. For additional information about AFL, its products and services, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
