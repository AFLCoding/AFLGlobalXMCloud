        <div>Spartanburg, SC  – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, was a recipient of the 2019 Excellence in Corporate Responsibility award presented by the <a href="https://myscma.com/">South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance</a> (SCMA). This award recognizes manufacturers who have excelled in community involvement and philanthropy, wellness and safety, and environmental stewardship.<br />
        AFL’s extensive <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">community outreach program </a>has made an impact in Upstate SC communities through grants, sponsorships, volunteer projects, disaster relief and more. AFL’s largest community outreach initiative is its annual <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/news/afl-associates-present-287-000-campaign-donation-to-united-way-of-the-piedmont?prevItm=0&prevCol=2059670&ts=10329">United Way campaign</a>. AFL’s 2018 campaign resulted in a $287K donation to United Way of Piedmont. Additionally, many associates also give their time to get involved at local schools to encourage STEM education, to mentor students through Big Brothers Big Sisters or Mentor Upstate, and to support local organizations such as Habitat for Humanity with their time.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=42FDC709BA964169AF29F0445E1F59A1&_z=z">Environment, Health & Safety</a> is one of AFL’s core values, and AFL is committed to continually growing and succeeding in these areas. Last year, AFL’s accessories division reached a record-breaking milestone of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=94BECA9E535646AEA5BD03140B25D47B&_z=z">5,000,000 safe work hours</a>. And most recently, five of AFL’s Spartanburg manufacturing locations received the <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/news/afl-spartanburg-manufacturing-facilities-awarded-for-workplace-safety">SCMA Plant Safety Award</a>. These results reflect AFL’s continual commitment to wellness and safety.<br />
        <br />
        Lastly, AFL is constantly pursuing new ways to increase environmental stewardship. All facilities promote continuous improvement in recycling and efficiency in our energy and water use. AFL also supports the <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/news/afl-associates-partner-with-treesgreenville-for-releaf-day">TreesGreenville annual ReLEAF day</a>, promotes office/plant recycling opportunities, and supports Palmetto Pride by sponsoring a two-mile stretch of I-85 for clean-up by the DOC.<br />
        <br />
        Fourteen manufacturers around the state of South Carolina received this recognition from the SCMA, the voice for manufacturing in South Carolina. To learn more about AFL, its products and services, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC  – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, was a recipient of the 2019 Excellence in Corporate Responsibility award presented by the <a href="https://myscma.com/">South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance</a> (SCMA). This award recognizes manufacturers who have excelled in community involvement and philanthropy, wellness and safety, and environmental stewardship.<br />
        AFL’s extensive <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">community outreach program </a>has made an impact in Upstate SC communities through grants, sponsorships, volunteer projects, disaster relief and more. AFL’s largest community outreach initiative is its annual <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/news/afl-associates-present-287-000-campaign-donation-to-united-way-of-the-piedmont?prevItm=0&prevCol=2059670&ts=10329">United Way campaign</a>. AFL’s 2018 campaign resulted in a $287K donation to United Way of Piedmont. Additionally, many associates also give their time to get involved at local schools to encourage STEM education, to mentor students through Big Brothers Big Sisters or Mentor Upstate, and to support local organizations such as Habitat for Humanity with their time.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=42FDC709BA964169AF29F0445E1F59A1&_z=z">Environment, Health & Safety</a> is one of AFL’s core values, and AFL is committed to continually growing and succeeding in these areas. Last year, AFL’s accessories division reached a record-breaking milestone of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=94BECA9E535646AEA5BD03140B25D47B&_z=z">5,000,000 safe work hours</a>. And most recently, five of AFL’s Spartanburg manufacturing locations received the <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/news/afl-spartanburg-manufacturing-facilities-awarded-for-workplace-safety">SCMA Plant Safety Award</a>. These results reflect AFL’s continual commitment to wellness and safety.<br />
        <br />
        Lastly, AFL is constantly pursuing new ways to increase environmental stewardship. All facilities promote continuous improvement in recycling and efficiency in our energy and water use. AFL also supports the <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/news/afl-associates-partner-with-treesgreenville-for-releaf-day">TreesGreenville annual ReLEAF day</a>, promotes office/plant recycling opportunities, and supports Palmetto Pride by sponsoring a two-mile stretch of I-85 for clean-up by the DOC.<br />
        <br />
        Fourteen manufacturers around the state of South Carolina received this recognition from the SCMA, the voice for manufacturing in South Carolina. To learn more about AFL, its products and services, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
