        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a division of Fujikura Ltd., announces updated firmware for the Fujikura <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0BC88231EF5D46C984DEAF0F3EA9EFD2&_z=z">CT-104</a>/<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F151ABBB387443BCB4D123DEDBDDCEA3&_z=z">105</a>/<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B3D0F41A3E634FACAF975855E8BAA361&_z=z">106</a> fiber optic LDF (Large Diameter Fiber) cleavers. The new version, 01.010a, includes a special cleaving function that makes a small score on the surface of the fiber, increasing the tension until the fiber breaks. Originally, the CT-series cleavers applied a predefined tension to the fiber being cleaved and a blade struck the fiber surface until the fiber broke.<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/CT-105_PR.aspx" target="_blank"></a><br />
         <br />
        “This method of cleaving produces a much better endface quality for special fiber cleaving such as high dopant fibers, capillary tubing, and air-hole or PCF fibers,” explained Brad Hendrix, global specialty marketing manager for AFL.<br />
         <br />
        <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=97DE1C0D6E8749508DF3FA4FF87FA83E&_z=z">Fujikura’s LDF cleavers</a> provide advanced cleaving solutions for end-users in fiber and laser manufacturing, fiber sensor manufacturing across the oil and gas sectors, university and R&D divisions, submarine cabling, defense, optical components and medical applications. With the ability to cleave 80 μm to 1.25 mm diameter fibers, flat and angled, the cleaver’s programming features allow for optimal and consistent results.<br />
         <br />
        The LDF cleaver offers extensive programmable features including a programmable automatic clamp function, an angle cleaving function (0 – 15° for fibers up to 800 µm), storage for up to 100 program modes, a blade life of 20,000 cleaves with a cladding diameter of 125 µm and applicable optical fiber, including glass optical fibers and capillary. Additionally, the product supports single fibers and features a color LCD monitor.<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a division of Fujikura Ltd., announces updated firmware for the Fujikura <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0BC88231EF5D46C984DEAF0F3EA9EFD2&_z=z">CT-104</a>/<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F151ABBB387443BCB4D123DEDBDDCEA3&_z=z">105</a>/<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B3D0F41A3E634FACAF975855E8BAA361&_z=z">106</a> fiber optic LDF (Large Diameter Fiber) cleavers. The new version, 01.010a, includes a special cleaving function that makes a small score on the surface of the fiber, increasing the tension until the fiber breaks. Originally, the CT-series cleavers applied a predefined tension to the fiber being cleaved and a blade struck the fiber surface until the fiber broke.<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/CT-105_PR.aspx" target="_blank"></a><br />
         <br />
        “This method of cleaving produces a much better endface quality for special fiber cleaving such as high dopant fibers, capillary tubing, and air-hole or PCF fibers,” explained Brad Hendrix, global specialty marketing manager for AFL.<br />
         <br />
        <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=97DE1C0D6E8749508DF3FA4FF87FA83E&_z=z">Fujikura’s LDF cleavers</a> provide advanced cleaving solutions for end-users in fiber and laser manufacturing, fiber sensor manufacturing across the oil and gas sectors, university and R&D divisions, submarine cabling, defense, optical components and medical applications. With the ability to cleave 80 μm to 1.25 mm diameter fibers, flat and angled, the cleaver’s programming features allow for optimal and consistent results.<br />
         <br />
        The LDF cleaver offers extensive programmable features including a programmable automatic clamp function, an angle cleaving function (0 – 15° for fibers up to 800 µm), storage for up to 100 program modes, a blade life of 20,000 cleaves with a cladding diameter of 125 µm and applicable optical fiber, including glass optical fibers and capillary. Additionally, the product supports single fibers and features a color LCD monitor.<br />
