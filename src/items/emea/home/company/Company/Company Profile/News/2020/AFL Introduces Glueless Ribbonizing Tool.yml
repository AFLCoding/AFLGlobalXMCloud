        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, introduces a new <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B4715D57B9CE44AF9D774ECFD57C68BB&_z=z">ribbonizing tool</a>, the RT-02, the first ribbonizing tool that features a glue-less process for ribbonizing and splicing 12-fiber ribbons. The new tool saves time and money by eliminating inefficiencies such as glue cure time and contamination of splicing equipment.
         <br />
        “Fujikura has implemented detailed ease-of-use features that must be seen to be appreciated,” explained Greg Pickeral, fusion splicer product manager for AFL. “Those who have ribbonized with traditional methods will <em>really </em>see and feel the difference.”<br />
         <br />
        The RT-02 ribbonizer is suitable for ribbonizing 200 µm and 250 µm loose fibers, 200 µm and 250 µm MPO termination, and mass fusion splicing loose fiber cables. Loading in order of the color code sequence is not required as with traditional ribbonizing tools. Fibers can be inserted at will and load directly into the fiber holder after inserting all 12 fibers.<br />
         <br />
        AFL offers a complete fusion splicing solution that includes <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D7C79E7446824C5EB9AC5D4FC49EEE96&_z=z">field</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DA14C8AA4D764D438F6CE692AD03276A&_z=z">specialty fusion splicers</a> plus accessories. AFL operates the only authorized repair facility for Fujikura splicing products in the U.S. Technical support is available 24/7 and complimentary on-site training is available with every splicer purchased.

        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, introduces a new <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B4715D57B9CE44AF9D774ECFD57C68BB&_z=z">ribbonizing tool</a>, the RT-02, the first ribbonizing tool that features a glue-less process for ribbonizing and splicing 12-fiber ribbons. The new tool saves time and money by eliminating inefficiencies such as glue cure time and contamination of splicing equipment.
         <br />
        “Fujikura has implemented detailed ease-of-use features that must be seen to be appreciated,” explained Greg Pickeral, fusion splicer product manager for AFL. “Those who have ribbonized with traditional methods will <em>really </em>see and feel the difference.”<br />
         <br />
        The RT-02 ribbonizer is suitable for ribbonizing 200 µm and 250 µm loose fibers, 200 µm and 250 µm MPO termination, and mass fusion splicing loose fiber cables. Loading in order of the color code sequence is not required as with traditional ribbonizing tools. Fibers can be inserted at will and load directly into the fiber holder after inserting all 12 fibers.<br />
         <br />
        AFL offers a complete fusion splicing solution that includes <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D7C79E7446824C5EB9AC5D4FC49EEE96&_z=z">field</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DA14C8AA4D764D438F6CE692AD03276A&_z=z">specialty fusion splicers</a> plus accessories. AFL operates the only authorized repair facility for Fujikura splicing products in the U.S. Technical support is available 24/7 and complimentary on-site training is available with every splicer purchased.
