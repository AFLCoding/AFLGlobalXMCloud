        AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=06416D54D8244BD1AE1B9BD4A76356D6&_z=z">LightLink LL-550 Optical Splicing and Distribution Enclosure</a> is a compact wall-mounted enclosure that provides for organizing, splicing and interconnecting fibers. This enclosure is ideal for business service hand-offs, MDU distribution and connectivity, cellular backhaul and other commercial services that require weather-proof field connectivity, but may have size constraints. The LL-550 is available with up to 48 SC UPC or APC connections as well as a splice-only configuration for up to 144 single fusion splices or 576 ribbon fibers with mass fusion.<br />
        <br />
        <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/LM200_LoRez.aspx" target="_blank"></a>The LM200-Series OSP MicroCore product design integrates the latest technology, 200 μm buffered single-mode fiber which allows for reduced diameter cables compared to traditional OSP micro-cables. Available from 24 to 432-fibers, the cable consists of a multi-fiber-set, gel-filled buffer tube construction. With the low-friction, high-strength overall jacketing system, the cable core is protected and supports high-speed, long-distance jetting performance.<br />
        <br />
        FOCIS Duel is a fiber inspection probe with two optical ports, one optimized for fast subjective patch cord end-face inspection, with the second port supporting all the comprehensive features of AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A5294A0B18184D9FBEABE71007538173&_z=z">FOCIS Flex inspection system</a>. FOCIS Duel has no moving parts and requires no operator adjustments to deliver fast automatic image analysis to industry standards and custom criteria. Linked wirelessly to AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4C1A455A2E234F3A968C0A26C07049A8&_z=z">aeRos® cloud-based work flow management platform</a>, FOCIS Duel is a complete solution.<br />
