        Released in January 2020, the Fujikura 90R features ergonomic improvements and automation designed to maximize productivity in the field.<br />

The fusion splicer is provided with a spare 12-fiber V-groove and electrode assembly which can be quickly exchanged in the field. Additional features include cleaver tracking and upkeep with wireless communication; 200 µm and 250 µm SpiderWeb Ribbon® universal ribbon prep accessories, a 5.0” touchscreen and multi-function transit case.<br />
