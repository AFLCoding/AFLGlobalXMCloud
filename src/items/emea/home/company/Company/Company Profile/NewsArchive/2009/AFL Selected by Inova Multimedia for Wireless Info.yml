        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Chosen to deliver the TFT-based infotainment solution for the next generation railway cars, Inova Multimedia, the German-based technology company that specializes in digital signage and media for transportation applications, signed a long term contract with NBC Universal. AFL has been contracted by Inova to design the Wi-Fi transmission system and install BelAir Networks wireless infrastructure in several train stations.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">"AFL’s solution was focused on providing Inova with the very best in terms of bandwidth throughput, scalability and reliability.

BelAir’s wireless networks will provide connectivity to the Inova technology located in each rail car, refreshing video content, advertising and passenger information provided by NBC Universal and the train operator. With a digital transmission system between the operation control center and the trains, passengers will be informed about the latest news, weather and sports and also the up-to-date ticketing information and travel updates about their journey.</p>
