        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, recognized several associates for patent awards received for developing new products and technologies within the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&_z=z">optical connectivity</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DD697FB3AFEA42B2B976EB9288D04701&_z=z">accessories</a> divisions.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s optical connectivity division received two patents. The first is for a cable tie-down, a modular clamp used in an optical splicing and distribution enclosure. In the enclosure, a service provider can select the panel bottom plate (with corresponding NPT fittings). Different-sized cable tie-down brackets can be connected to the NPT fitting in the enclosure bottom plate to allow for secure cable retention. The second patent is for a modified registered jack-style plug for direct attachment to a circuit board used in customer installation of communication equipment.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s accessories division received a patent for a swage press die. The die’s unique shape allows AFL to limit the range of stress in the bending regions of the swage die and control the finished crimp shape. The decreased range of stress allows a lower tensile strength material to be used in the same application without fatigue.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=431D3DE29E3C414FA1F550BEA1C90139&_z=z">Swage accessories</a> use a compression technology process called "swaging" that enables installation of aluminum accessories without the need of a welder. Swage products allow an electric utility to install the accessories faster and more efficiently with lower installation costs over the welding process. The Swage accessories complement AFL’s Substation products which are made for low voltage up to 765 kV applications that involve cable, pipe, flat or tubular bus and integral web connections.<br />
