        Spartanburg, SC – AFL introduces a small diameter interconnect cable based on the MicroCore product line. The new <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Enterprise/Inside-Plant-Cable/Interconnect-Premise-MicroCore-Cable.aspx">MicroCore Interconnect Cable</a> boasts one of the smallest diameters in the market, offering unmatched density for short distance interconnects. The diameter of the 12 fiber cable has been reduced by 30 percent and the 24 fiber cable has been reduced by 20 percent. To minimize the cable’s diameter, multiple colored 250 μm fibers and aramid strands are packaged in a high performance jacket.<br />
        <br />
        “Matching this design to connector hardware that is available in standard configurations from connector manufacturers was a key to the overall design concept,” stated Doug Baker, commercial manager for premise and enterprise cables at AFL. “Customers can take off-the-shelf connector solutions and apply them to this cable design without having to build or source custom components.”<br />
        <br />
        Ideal for data centers and central offices as well as building interconnections, skew performance is exceptional and routing is much easier due to its round overall construction. Interconnect Premise MicroCore Cables are designed primarily for use with both factory installed MPO/MTP terminations as well as field-installable MPO solutions like AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Connectors-and-Accessories/Field-Installable-Connectors/FuseConnect-MPO.aspx">FuseConnect MPO</a>. Fiber counts from eight to 48 fibers are available. Simplex and zip cord designs are also available in specific configurations.<br />
