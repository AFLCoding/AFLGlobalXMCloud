        <p>Tukwila, WA and Centennial, CO – <a href="http://www.lightbrigade.com/">The Light Brigade</a>, <a href="/">AFL</a>’s training division, and <a href="http://www.jonesncti.com/">Jones/NCTI</a> have joined together to offer a comprehensive two-day, instructor-led Fiber Optics Workshop for Jones/NCTI graduates of Fiber Installation and Activation and Fiber Testing and Maintenance courses. This hands-on course is presented in a lab format with multiple stations and features the latest in fiber optic technology, products and standards. Students will be provided the practical understanding and skills required to properly design, install and maintain fiber optic networks.<br />
         <br />
        “I am excited about offering the hands-on fiber training with The Light Brigade. This alliance is a win, win, win! Jones/NCTI students win by receiving industry-leading hands-on training, the MSO wins as their staff gains required and highly sought skills, and Jones/NCTI and The Light Brigade win by expanding our successful relationship,” said Vincent DiBiase, president of Jones/NCTI.<br />
         <br />
        This course will enhance what students have previously learned in Jones/NCTI fiber courses with the added benefit of face-to-face guidance from instructors well-versed in this highly-specialized and indispensable subject. Beginners to experienced fiber technicians will benefit from this exclusive offer. Upon successful completion of this hands-on course, the student will have the experience required to immediately contribute to the building and maintenance of a fiber optic network. Upon successful completion, students will receive a Jones/NCTI certificate of graduation and The Light Brigade’s certificate of completion.<br />
