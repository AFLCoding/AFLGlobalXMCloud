        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;"><strong>Spartanburg, SC</strong> - AFL announces that Spartanburg Methodist College (SMC) is the recipient of a $2,500 Fujikura Foundation grant to support its Campus Service program. Through Campus Service, SMC provides two college students to assist at Carver Junior High School with the AVID program which pulls students out of unchallenging course and places them on the college track.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">"Among the leaders of the Upstate area, and the State of South Carolina, one of the main concerns is that we all need to come together to raise the number of college-educated persons in our state," said Mr. Donald Tate, Director of Development for SMC. "As we develop a successful track record at Carver Junior High School, support to this program is crucial. We appreciate the donation by the Fujikura Foundation and look forward to having a positive impact on the lives of students in our area."</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Carver Junior High is the first school in the Upstate of South Carolina to implement this program which is being used in 3,800 schools in 45 states, Washington, DC, and 15 countries with over 200,000 students enrolled in the AVID elective. The primary purpose of the AVID program is to increase the college-going rate for students from low-income and minority families.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">"AFL is excited to have the opportunity to support SMC and the AVID program here in the Upstate," stated Corie Culp, Community Relations Manager for AFL. "We are committed to improving education and success rates in the state of South Carolina and believe we have an impact serving SMC's efforts."</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">The mission of Spartanburg Methodist College is to develop the worth and abilities of each individual through programs relevant to academic and personal needs. This program offers students the option of transferring to a four-year college or university for continued study or entering a career after graduation.</p>

        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;"><strong>Spartanburg, SC</strong> - AFL announces that Spartanburg Methodist College (SMC) is the recipient of a $2,500 Fujikura Foundation grant to support its Campus Service program. Through Campus Service, SMC provides two college students to assist at Carver Junior High School with the AVID program which pulls students out of unchallenging course and places them on the college track.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">"Among the leaders of the Upstate area, and the State of South Carolina, one of the main concerns is that we all need to come together to raise the number of college-educated persons in our state," said Mr. Donald Tate, Director of Development for SMC. "As we develop a successful track record at Carver Junior High School, support to this program is crucial. We appreciate the donation by the Fujikura Foundation and look forward to having a positive impact on the lives of students in our area."</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Carver Junior High is the first school in the Upstate of South Carolina to implement this program which is being used in 3,800 schools in 45 states, Washington, DC, and 15 countries with over 200,000 students enrolled in the AVID elective. The primary purpose of the AVID program is to increase the college-going rate for students from low-income and minority families.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">"AFL is excited to have the opportunity to support SMC and the AVID program here in the Upstate," stated Corie Culp, Community Relations Manager for AFL. "We are committed to improving education and success rates in the state of South Carolina and believe we have an impact serving SMC's efforts."</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">The mission of Spartanburg Methodist College is to develop the worth and abilities of each individual through programs relevant to academic and personal needs.
