        <strong>Spartanburg, SC </strong>- On Saturday, December 8, nine AFL's associates, several members of Boy Scout Troop 603 and Cub Scout Pack 733, as well as friends and family, joined together at the Pavilion in Greenville County to plant trees in recognition of Arbor Day in South Carolina. In conjunction with the Greenville County Recreation District, volunteers gathered to plant five Red Maples and five Cryptomeria on the grounds of the Pavilion, with the larger trees planted near the road and the smaller trees near the building itself.<br />
        <br />
        The volunteer project is part of AFL’s Take Root tree program which supports tree plantings internationally. The company has a goal to plant 5,000 trees by the year 2010. Ty Houck, Director of Greenways, Natural and Historical Resources, and Matt Arms, Maintenance Technician, both with the Greenville County Creation District, were on site to oversee the project.<br />
        <br />
        “The Greenville County Recreation District is fortunate to be a partner in AFL's long-term commitment to plant trees throughout the world,” stated Houck. “It was great to see parents and kids having fun and planting trees. Trees are the first victims of development but thanks to AFL, we are helping get trees re-established in our living landscapes.”<br />
        <br />
        “We look forward to the Fall tree planting season each year,” said Corie Culp, Community Relations Manager for AFL. “It’s one way we can give back to our community, partnering with the Recreation District, while supporting our local Boy Scout and Cub Scout troops and their community service initiatives. It’s a win-win-win!”<br />
