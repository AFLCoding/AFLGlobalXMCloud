        Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> introduces the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/M700_Compact_SM_and_MM_OTDRs.aspx">M710 high performance OTDR</a> with TruEvent™ Technology. The M710 is AFL’s longest-reaching single-mode OTDR that enables the test and characterization of links in excess of 200 km. Combining industry leading event analysis with long range capability provides a powerful tool for testing many of today’s fiber optic networks.<br />
        <br />
        The M710 includes an integrated optical power meter and visual fault locator and integrates with <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Software/Test-Results-Manager-PC-Analysis-and-Reporting.aspx">Test Results Manager</a> (TRM™) Certification Reporting Software for comprehensive reports compliant to TIA/ISO guidelines.<br />
        <br />
        “Fiber networks can be long or short, have many connections and splices or very few. Combining high dynamic range performance and superior event analysis makes the M710-40 OTDR a powerful test solution for many applications,” commented Lee Kellett, director of product marketing for AFL’s test equipment division.<br />
        <br />
        The M710-40 OTDR has the many popular features found in other M-series OTDRs, including live fiber detection, pass/fail reporting, front panel check and inspection capability. The new OTDR supports Full Auto, Expert (manual) and Real-Time OTDR test modes, multi-wavelength testing and visual inspection using the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/DFS1-Digital-FiberScope.aspx">DFS1 Digital FiberScope</a>. <br />
        <br />
        Thousands of OTDR test results can be saved as standard .SOR files and stored internally or on the supplied USB drive. Test results are transferable via USB to a computer for analyzing with the supplied Windows®-compatible TRM software.<br />
        <br />
        Several other M710 models with TruEvent Technology will be available by mid-year. For additional information about AFL, its products and services, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />

        “Fiber networks can be long or short, have many connections and splices or very few. Combining high dynamic range performance and superior event analysis makes the M710-40 OTDR a powerful test solution for many applications,” commented Lee Kellett, director of product marketing for AFL’s test equipment division.<br />
        <br />
        The M710-40 OTDR has the many popular features found in other M-series OTDRs, including live fiber detection, pass/fail reporting, front panel check and inspection capability. The new OTDR supports Full Auto, Expert (manual) and Real-Time OTDR test modes, multi-wavelength testing and visual inspection using the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/DFS1-Digital-FiberScope.aspx">DFS1 Digital FiberScope</a>. <br />
        <br />
        Thousands of OTDR test results can be saved as standard .SOR files and stored internally or on the supplied USB drive. Test results are transferable via USB to a computer for analyzing with the supplied Windows®-compatible TRM software.<br />
        <br />
        Several other M710 models with TruEvent Technology will be available by mid-year. For additional information about AFL, its products and services, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
