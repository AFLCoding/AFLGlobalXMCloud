        Halifax, Nova Scotia and Duncan, South Carolina - SolutionInc Limited (TSX-VEN:STL), a global leader in Internet management solutions, and AFL, a leading telecommunications product and services supplier, announced today the signing of a reseller agreement whereby AFL will sell and support SolutionInc’s products. The agreement will focus within the North American hospitality market and will include AFL’s clients within the exploding Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) segment.<br />
        <br />
        SolutionInc offers a robust IP provisioning and management engine that makes it easy for any broadband service provider to deploy secure Internet access, regardless if the network connection wired or wireless. The IP management system, SolutionIP™, includes award-winning Internet provisioning, authentication and billing software.<br />
        <br />
        Clark Squires, SolutionInc’s Senior Vice President of Sales and Partnerships comments, “AFL has clearly identified the opportunity for providing end-to-end solutions to the hospitality and broadband service provider markets. Network operators are searching for complete product and service solutions that not only provide future proof infrastructure, but meet their needs for advanced network provisioning and management. We are thrilled to be part of this exciting opportunity.”<br />
        <br />
        An established market leader in providing fiber-optic based telecommunications products and complete engineering, furnish and install (EF&I) services to telecom and enterprise segments, AFL expects SolutionInc’s portfolio to accelerate growth in market segments served by both the product and network services segments of its business.  “SolutionInc is an ideal partner for AFL – they have established market leadership in the hospitality segment – a key growth area for us. As hotel operators look to advance their voice, data and video amenities, AFL will respond by bringing a robust end-to-end solution independent of project size,” stated Kent Brown, Director, AFL Access Solutions.<br />
        <br />
        “This relationship combines the market position, capabilities and strengths of two market leaders. We share a passion for providing leading-edge solutions that are helping hospitality operators reshape how guests interact with technology amenities. National and international hotel operators are seeking partners such as AFL to provide consistent solutions that are independent of property size and location. This partnership is well equipped to meet this need,” added Squires.<br />
