        <p>British Columbia, Canada and Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /Home ">AFL</a> achieved its certification for COR, a Certificate of Recognition issued by the <a href="https://www.bccsa.ca/">British Columbia Construction Safety Association</a> (BCCSA). The COR program recognizes companies who develop and implement effective health, safety and injury management systems that meet industry standards. Aligned with AFL’s <a href="http://aflconnects.com/hr/Pages/Mission-Vision-and-Core-Values ">core values</a>, the certification demonstrates AFL’s commitment to the safety of their associates, clients and the general public while delivering an expansive portfolio of telecom services.</p>
        <p>Following an external audit of its Health and Safety program, AFL British Columbia was recertified as a COR partner through the BCCSA. The auditor conducted many site inspections and associate interviews over several days.</p>
        <p>“A huge effort was put forth by the Operations department to ensure that the Health and Safety program was being followed and that any area of improvement was identified and implemented,” said Jordan Young, senior vice president of AFL’s Premise Services in Canada.</p>
        <p>In adherence with AFL’s core values, safety is the number one topic in boardrooms across BC. According to Young, “Our focus is and will continue to be creating an environment where all AFL associates put safety as the number one priority in their day. It is imperative that our team, from top to bottom, commit to this goal and continue to demonstrate that there is no job worth doing unsafely.”</p>
        <p>AFL British Columbia formed a Joint Occupational Health and Safety Committee to noticeably improve Health and Safety in 2016. The Committee members received formal training which clearly outlines their roles and responsibilities, allowing associate safety concerns and recommendations to be appropriately addressed in a timely matter.</p>
        <p>With more than 4,500 associates worldwide, AFL connects customers to product and service solutions designed to maximize networks. For more information about AFL, its product and services, visit <a href=" /">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.</p>

        <p>British Columbia, Canada and Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /Home ">AFL</a> achieved its certification for COR, a Certificate of Recognition issued by the <a href="https://www.bccsa.ca/">British Columbia Construction Safety Association</a> (BCCSA). The COR program recognizes companies who develop and implement effective health, safety and injury management systems that meet industry standards. Aligned with AFL’s <a href="http://aflconnects.com/hr/Pages/Mission-Vision-and-Core-Values ">core values</a>, the certification demonstrates AFL’s commitment to the safety of their associates, clients and the general public while delivering an expansive portfolio of telecom services.</p>
        <p>Following an external audit of its Health and Safety program, AFL British Columbia was recertified as a COR partner through the BCCSA. The auditor conducted many site inspections and associate interviews over several days.</p>
        <p>“A huge effort was put forth by the Operations department to ensure that the Health and Safety program was being followed and that any area of improvement was identified and implemented,” said Jordan Young, senior vice president of AFL’s Premise Services in Canada.</p>
        <p>In adherence with AFL’s core values, safety is the number one topic in boardrooms across BC. According to Young, “Our focus is and will continue to be creating an environment where all AFL associates put safety as the number one priority in their day. It is imperative that our team, from top to bottom, commit to this goal and continue to demonstrate that there is no job worth doing unsafely.”</p>
        <p>AFL British Columbia formed a Joint Occupational Health and Safety Committee to noticeably improve Health and Safety in 2016. The Committee members received formal training which clearly outlines their roles and responsibilities, allowing associate safety concerns and recommendations to be appropriately addressed in a timely matter.</p>
