        Swindon, UK and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, presented a £1,150 <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">community outreach</a> grant to <a href="http://www.prospect-hospice.net/Home">Prospect Hospice</a>, an organisation that works within the Swindon community in partnership with patients, their families and organisations to provide and influence excellent care, support and understanding at end-of-life. The grant will support a new in-patient riser/recliner chair designed to promote independence and mobility with the use of pressure-relieving cushions. The chair provides a comfortable alternative to remaining in bed for patients.<br />
        <br />
        “End-of-life care can be particularly demanding for care givers, but Prospect Hospice provides superb services to support both patients and their care givers,” commented Joanne Lawrence, community outreach coordinator at AFL Europe. “AFL associates are always enthusiastic in their support of Prospect Hospice and we have enjoyed getting to know them over the years. We’re confident the funding will be beneficial to them now and in the future.”<br />
        <br />
        Prospect Hospice’s in-patient unit has 16 beds that are almost fully occupied by patients who choose the security of being based in hospice at the end of their lives.<br />
        <br />
        “The in-patient unit is a place where extraordinary care is given and the focus on individual care needs of the patient is always our foremost consideration,” said Richard Hammond, deputy chief executive of Prospect Hospice. “We are so thankful to AFL and its associates for this grant as well as the other ways they support our organisation throughout the year.”<br />
        <br />
