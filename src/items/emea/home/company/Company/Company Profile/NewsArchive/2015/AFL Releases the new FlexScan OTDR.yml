        <div class="content" id="contentWide">Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC –<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>introduces<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/Singlemode-OTDRs-Fault-Locators-Telco-Broadband/FlexScan-OTDR.aspx">FlexScan</a>, the new pocket-sized, hand-held<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators.aspx">OTDR</a>which provides fast, accurate fiber optic network characterization and fault location. Combining SmartAuto™ data acquisition with event analysis and intuitive LinkMap™ display, FlexScan enables technicians to quickly and easily troubleshoot faulty optical networks, or completely characterize newly installed networks.<br />
        <br />
        “FlexScan‘s SmartAuto™ simplifies test setup, while LinkMap™ clarifies OTDR results, making it easy for any technician to perform testing,” explains Michael Scholten, senior product marketing manager at AFL. “As the number of fiber-based networks continues to grow, FlexScan enables carriers and contract installers to equip each technician with an all-in-one fiber test solution that literally fits in their pocket.”<br />
        <br />
        FlexScan’s SmartAuto™ technology automatically selects the most appropriate OTDR settings to detect, locate, identify and measure network start, end, connectors, splices and macro-bends. LinkMap™ technology applies pass/fail limits to detected events, displays the network using color-coded icons to highlight faults and recommends corrective action to resolve faults.<br />
        <br />
        Available in either single or dual-wavelength OTDR configurations, FlexScan includes integrated VFL, plus optional loss test set (source and power meter), Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® communications.<br />
        <br />
        Designed for outside plant technicians,<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/Singlemode-OTDRs-Fault-Locators-Telco-Broadband/FlexScan-OTDR.aspx">FlexScan</a>is rugged yet lightweight, provides a large, backlit indoor/outdoor color display and operates up to 12 hours from its rechargeable battery. Results may be stored internally or to a USB memory stick. Internally stored results are easily uploaded via USB, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for archiving or report generation using the included TRM™ 2.0 Test Results Manager software.<br />

        <div class="content" id="contentWide">Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC –<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>introduces<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/Singlemode-OTDRs-Fault-Locators-Telco-Broadband/FlexScan-OTDR.aspx">FlexScan</a>, the new pocket-sized, hand-held<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators.aspx">OTDR</a>which provides fast, accurate fiber optic network characterization and fault location. Combining SmartAuto™ data acquisition with event analysis and intuitive LinkMap™ display, FlexScan enables technicians to quickly and easily troubleshoot faulty optical networks, or completely characterize newly installed networks.<br />
        <br />
        “FlexScan‘s SmartAuto™ simplifies test setup, while LinkMap™ clarifies OTDR results, making it easy for any technician to perform testing,” explains Michael Scholten, senior product marketing manager at AFL. “As the number of fiber-based networks continues to grow, FlexScan enables carriers and contract installers to equip each technician with an all-in-one fiber test solution that literally fits in their pocket.”<br />
        <br />
        FlexScan’s SmartAuto™ technology automatically selects the most appropriate OTDR settings to detect, locate, identify and measure network start, end, connectors, splices and macro-bends. LinkMap™ technology applies pass/fail limits to detected events, displays the network using color-coded icons to highlight faults and recommends corrective action to resolve faults.<br />
        <br />
        Available in either single or dual-wavelength OTDR configurations, FlexScan includes integrated VFL, plus optional loss test set (source and power meter), Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® communications.<br />
        <br />
        Designed for outside plant technicians,<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/Singlemode-OTDRs-Fault-Locators-Telco-Broadband/FlexScan-OTDR.aspx">FlexScan</a>is rugged yet lightweight, provides a large, backlit indoor/outdoor color display and operates up to 12 hours from its rechargeable battery. Results may be stored internally or to a USB memory stick. Internally stored results are easily uploaded via USB, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for archiving or report generation using the included TRM™ 2.0 Test Results Manager software.<br />
