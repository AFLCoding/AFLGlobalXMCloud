        Spartanburg, SC – Twenty-six <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a> associates volunteered their time to support the <a href="http://www.upstatefrc.org/">Upstate Family Resource Center</a> (UFRC), an organization whose mission is to help families thrive. Volunteers left their mark by painting entrance doors bright red, helped prepare for new LED signage by demolishing the old sign, organized storage space and did general cleaning to help the organization with projects that take a back seat to other priorities.<br />
        <br />
        “In one day, our team was able to complete what would have taken them weeks to complete,” commented Eric Ruby, customer service manager and volunteer for AFL. “Helping them with these projects means they can focus on students and families that need their services.” <br />
        <br />
        This volunteer service is known as an <a href="/Company/Community/ACT-Project">ACT Project</a>. A team of AFL associates, friends and family gather at a nonprofit organization to provide a service and in some cases, present a grant to the nonprofit. UFRC was the recipient of a $1,500 grant.<br />
        <br />
        Executive Director Kelley Ezell stated, “AFL Volunteers left us with a great sense of accomplishment! It felt great to close the doors on Friday knowing that so many important tasks had been checked off of our ever-growing list. Their hard work gave us the encouragement we need to keep moving forward.”<br />
        <br />
        UFRC help families thrive by focusing on Workforce Readiness, Family Development and Coaching for Success. Recently they launched Strive to Thrive University, a program which encourages families to participate in educational opportunities to receive credits which can be exchanged for services and items needed while they work on becoming self-sufficient. <br />
        <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="/Company/Community">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants, sponsorships, employee engagement projects, disaster relief and more.
