        Spartanburg, SC — AFL and Winchester Electronics have partnered to develop a customized Winchester KINGS® brand Fujikura fusion splicing system for installation of their Fiber Optic Tri-Loc® Camera Connectors for SMPTE 311 hybrid fiber optic cable and the AFL FuseConnect field installable connectors.<br />
        <br />
        Splicing of the Tri-Loc connector is performed using a special cable clamping system along with fiber holders designed to accept the Tri-Loc termini. This design allows for the use of a standard length connector housing for the connector. Both the V-groove and core alignment splicer models retain standard splicing functionality while incorporating enhanced features to provide the most reliable fusion splicers in the market today. The new rugged construction adds improved reliability by resisting shock, dust and rain.<br />
        <br />
        "Customers using Fiber Optic Tri-Loc Camera Connectors now have an easy and affordable way to install these in the field," said Greg Pickeral, Product Manager of Fusion Splicing Systems at AFL. "Our design retains all the standard functionality of both the 60S and 18S making this a truly versatile tool for those who install the Winchester Tri-Loc connectors or just splice standard fiber optic cables."<br />
        <br />
        Winchester Electronics, a leader in design, development and deployment of interconnect technology, designs and manufactures an extensive range of interconnect products, value-added cable and electromechanical assemblies. In partnering with AFL, Winchester adds a new product to the mix – a fiber optic fusion splicer customized for the broadcast market.<br />
        <br />
        "Winchester is excited to offer our customers the ability to fusion splice our Fiber Optic Tri-Loc Camera Connectors using customized Fujikura splicers," said Mark Yanzo, Marketing Manager for Winchester Electronics. "The partnership of Winchester and AFL delivers the best performance and value in the industry."<br />
        <br />
        The broadcast fusion splicer is available now from Winchester Electronics. For additional information, visitwww.AFLglobal.com or www.winchesterelectronics.com.<br />
