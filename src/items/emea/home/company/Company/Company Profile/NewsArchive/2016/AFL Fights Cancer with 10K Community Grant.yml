        Monterrey, Mexico and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, presented grants totaling $10,000 to two organizations dedicated to supporting cancer patients and their families. Made possible by AFL’s Community Outreach Program, the grants were presented to <a href="http://cruzrosa.org.mx/">Cruz Rosa</a> and <a href="http://www.acancer.org/">Alianza Anticancer Infantil</a>. <br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://cruzrosa.org.mx/">Cruz Rosa</a> supports low-income women diagnosed with breast cancer by providing a shelter where they are given accommodations, meals and care. The organization received a $7,000 grant to support <a href="http://cruzrosa.org.mx/institucion/programas/casa-cruz-rosa/">Hostel Casa Cruz Rosa</a>, a shelter where women with cancer are provided accommodations, meals, individual and group therapy, recreational, educational and occupational activities. One additional family member is allowed to stay in the shelter while their family member is seeking care. The house provides accommodations for 40 people—20 patients and 20 caregivers.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://www.acancer.org/">Alianza Anticancer Infantil</a> was the second recipient. Dedicated to supporting children with cancer and their families, Alianza Anticancer Infantil received a $3,000 grant to upgrade the multipurpose room, a common area for recreational and psychotherapeutic activities. Founded in 1995 by a group of parents facing issues surrounding the care of children with cancer, Alianza Anticancer Infantil ensures every child has the same opportunities for health care regardless of economic status.<br />
