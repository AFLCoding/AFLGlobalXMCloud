        Tukwila, WA and Spartanburg, SC – Light Brigade associates volunteered their time to work with Vision House to help serve the needs of the homeless in the area. Among the projects, volunteers organized the food and household items store, unpacked boxes and stocked shelves. Additionally, they prepared back-to-school supplies by unpacking, sorting and stocking donations. Orders were filled for delivery to shelters in the area. Another team of Light Brigade volunteers transferred wood chips to two playgrounds and weeded the community garden. Nearly 60 hours of service was provided to enrich the lives of those in need.
        <div> </div>
        <div>“Giving back to our community is one of our core values,” commented Lee Kellet, general manager for Light Brigade. “We believe we can make a difference – whether it’s one person or a team of people. In the short time we spent at Vision House, we supported children, families and the community, making it a better place to work, play and live. We are thrilled to have been a part of this organization.”  <br />

        Tukwila, WA and Spartanburg, SC – Light Brigade associates volunteered their time to work with Vision House to help serve the needs of the homeless in the area. Among the projects, volunteers organized the food and household items store, unpacked boxes and stocked shelves. Additionally, they prepared back-to-school supplies by unpacking, sorting and stocking donations. Orders were filled for delivery to shelters in the area. Another team of Light Brigade volunteers transferred wood chips to two playgrounds and weeded the community garden. Nearly 60 hours of service was provided to enrich the lives of those in need.

        <div>“Giving back to our community is one of our core values,” commented Lee Kellet, general manager for Light Brigade. “We believe we can make a difference – whether it’s one person or a team of people. In the short time we spent at Vision House, we supported children, families and the community, making it a better place to work, play and live. We are thrilled to have been a part of this organization.”  <br />
        <br />
