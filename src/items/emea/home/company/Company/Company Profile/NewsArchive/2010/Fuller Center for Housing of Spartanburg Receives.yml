        Spartanburg, SC - Members of AFL's Fujikura Foundation committee presented a $3,000 grant to The Fuller Center for Housing of Spartanburg, an organization that repairs and renovates home of senior citizens and disabled residents. The grant will support the revitalization of three homes in the Spartanburg area, ultimately providing the opportunity for citizens to stay at home as long as possible.<br />
        <br />
        AFL plans to further support the Fuller Center by sending out volunteers from the company to assist at a home in the Reidville area. Volunteers will gather over several weekends to provide assistance with home repairs and grounds work in the fall.<br />
        <br />
        “We were struck by the Fuller’s Center commitment to help those in need – especially those who want to stay in their homes, who are able to stay in their homes, and just need a helping hand to make it a safer place to reside,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “AFL is honored to assist our community and to a program that aids those in need.”<br />
        <br />
        In 2005, Millard and Linda Fuller launched The Fuller Center for Housing which is currently building and renovating homes in 17 countries and 57 communities in the United States. Its mission is to help the more than one billion people worldwide who live in poverty housing and the 100 million who are homeless.<br />
