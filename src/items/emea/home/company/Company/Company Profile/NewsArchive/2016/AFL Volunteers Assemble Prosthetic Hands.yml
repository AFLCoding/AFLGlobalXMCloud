        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a> volunteers participated in a unique experience that will transform the lives of multiple children. During the annual sales meeting, 40 sales managers and sales support associates <a href="/Company/Community/ACT-Project">volunteered</a> their time to assemble, adjust and fine-tune 10 3D-printed prosthetic hands to give to children with symbrachydactyly. Hosted by <a href="http://www.ventureup.com/">Venture Up</a>, an organization that provides corporate team building events, the project will support <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> who will distribute them to children between seven to 12 years old.<br />
        <br />
        “This volunteer project was unlike any other project we have undertaken in the past,” commented Steve Ferguson, vice president of sales and marketing for AFL. “Not only were we able to work as a team to enhance communication and collaboration, but we were also able to give back to our community in a very unique way. It’s exciting to know that 10 children from around the world will benefit from this project and have the ability to perform various tasks that we take for granted.”<br />
        <br />
        Symbrachydactyly occurs during normal embryonic development. When a baby’s hands begin to form in utero, they are shaped like mittens or paddles. Then the fingers divide. In babies with symbrachydactyly, the fingers don’t fully form. This hand disorder is characterized by abnormally short fingers that are sometimes webbed or conjoined. In severe cases, all fingers are missing and small nubbins of skin and soft-tissue are located where the fingers would have developed. Symbrachydactyly occurs in every 250,000 which equals about 2 million cases around the world.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://www.ventureup.com/">Venture Up</a> works with biomedical engineers and funds 3D printing technology for the production of low-cost prosthetic hands to enable people with no prior hand function to change their lives forever. The Creative Hands 3D Project directly supported the production and distribution of these prosthetics at no charge to the recipients or their families.<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a> volunteers participated in a unique experience that will transform the lives of multiple children. During the annual sales meeting, 40 sales managers and sales support associates <a href="/Company/Community/ACT-Project">volunteered</a> their time to assemble, adjust and fine-tune 10 3D-printed prosthetic hands to give to children with symbrachydactyly. Hosted by <a href="http://www.ventureup.com/">Venture Up</a>, an organization that provides corporate team building events, the project will support <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> who will distribute them to children between seven to 12 years old.<br />
        <br />
        “This volunteer project was unlike any other project we have undertaken in the past,” commented Steve Ferguson, vice president of sales and marketing for AFL. “Not only were we able to work as a team to enhance communication and collaboration, but we were also able to give back to our community in a very unique way. It’s exciting to know that 10 children from around the world will benefit from this project and have the ability to perform various tasks that we take for granted.”<br />
        <br />
        Symbrachydactyly occurs during normal embryonic development. When a baby’s hands begin to form in utero, they are shaped like mittens or paddles. Then the fingers divide. In babies with symbrachydactyly, the fingers don’t fully form. This hand disorder is characterized by abnormally short fingers that are sometimes webbed or conjoined. In severe cases, all fingers are missing and small nubbins of skin and soft-tissue are located where the fingers would have developed. Symbrachydactyly occurs in every 250,000 which equals about 2 million cases around the world.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://www.ventureup.com/">Venture Up</a> works with biomedical engineers and funds 3D printing technology for the production of low-cost prosthetic hands to enable people with no prior hand function to change their lives forever. The Creative Hands 3D Project directly supported the production and distribution of these prosthetics at no charge to the recipients or their families.<br />
