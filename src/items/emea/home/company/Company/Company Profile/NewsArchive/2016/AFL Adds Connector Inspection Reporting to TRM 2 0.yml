        Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /">AFL</a>’s <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection ">Test & Inspection</a> Division has added connector inspection reporting to its <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Software/Test-Results-Manager-PC-Analysis-and-Reporting ">TRM 2.0 Test Results Manager</a> software, a Windows®-based software designed to view test results and generate reports using data uploaded from AFL’s OTDRs, Optical Power Meters (OPM), Optical Loss Test Sets (OLTS) and/or FOCIS family of connector inspection probes.<br />
         <br />

        Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /">AFL</a>’s <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection ">Test & Inspection</a> Division has added connector inspection reporting to its <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Software/Test-Results-Manager-PC-Analysis-and-Reporting ">TRM 2.0 Test Results Manager</a> software, a Windows®-based software designed to view test results and generate reports using data uploaded from AFL’s OTDRs, Optical Power Meters (OPM), Optical Loss Test Sets (OLTS) and/or FOCIS family of connector inspection probes.<br />
         <br />
        With this update, TRM 2.0 software may be used to create inspection only reports, as well as combined OTDR, OLTS/OPM and inspection reports using images and pass/fail results from AFL’s <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-Flex-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-System ">FOCIS Flex</a> and <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-WiFi-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-System ">FOCIS WiFi</a> inspection solutions. TRM’s Report Wizard provides a variety of user-selectable cover page, summary and results templates enabling users to easily create comprehensive, professional reports.<br />
         <br />
        AFL includes TRM 2.0 with its OTDR and data-logging OPM Kits. With this release, AFL is also adding TRM 2.0 to FOCIS Flex and FOCIS WiFi Kits, ensuring users are able to produce printed or electronic reports from their connector inspection results. Included with <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Software/Test-Results-Manager-PC-Analysis-and-Reporting ">TRM 2.0</a> is an updated version of FOCIS2Go, AFL’s utility for copying and renaming inspection results files to associate them with separately uploaded OTDR, OLTS and/or OPM results. TRM also provides batch editing capabilities to easily edit and reapply OTDR or OLTS pass/fail limits before generating reports.<br />
         <br />
        <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-WiFi-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-System ">FOCIS Flex</a> is the industry’s first fully self-contained, auto-focusing inspection probe with integrated display, pass/fail analysis, rechargeable battery and internal storage plus Bluetooth® and USB interfaces. AFL’s <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-WiFi-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-System ">FOCIS Wi-Fi</a> inspection solution communicates via Wi-Fi to smartphones and tablets running the FOCIS Mobile app, converting them into advanced connector inspection tools. The FOCIS Mobile app is available for Android and iOS devices from Google Play and the Apple App Store at no charge.<br />
