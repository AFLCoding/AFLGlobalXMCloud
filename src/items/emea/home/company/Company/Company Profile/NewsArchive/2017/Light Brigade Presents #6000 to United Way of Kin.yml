        Tukwila, WA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.lightbrigade.com/Home.aspx">Light Brigade</a>, <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>’s training and education division, completed its annual United Way campaign with a $6,000 donation to <a href="https://www.uwkc.org/">United Way of King County</a>. This marks the fifth year that Light Brigade has embarked on a United Way campaign that supports youth, builds financial stability, ends homelessness and gives kids an equal chance.<br />
        <br />
        “Although we are a small organization, we can still make a huge difference in the lives of others,” commented Lee Kellett, general manager of Light Brigade. “Our associates understand the need in our community and they respond in meaningful ways—through our annual giving campaign and volunteer opportunities.”<br />
        <br />
        The donation was made possible by Light Brigade associates who increased their annual donation by nearly 40 percent over 2015. And with the help of AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>, the donation to United Way increased even more.<br />
        <br />
        The theme for this year’s United Way campaign was “Be Someone’s Hero.” The one-week campaign started with a super-hero lunch presentation by Harold Baker and Lydia Landry from United Way of King County. Associates gained a better understanding of their local United Way and the “Fuel Your Future” program designed to connect children to nutritious food throughout the year.    <br />

        Tukwila, WA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.lightbrigade.com/Home.aspx">Light Brigade</a>, <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>’s training and education division, completed its annual United Way campaign with a $6,000 donation to <a href="https://www.uwkc.org/">United Way of King County</a>. This marks the fifth year that Light Brigade has embarked on a United Way campaign that supports youth, builds financial stability, ends homelessness and gives kids an equal chance.<br />
        <br />
        “Although we are a small organization, we can still make a huge difference in the lives of others,” commented Lee Kellett, general manager of Light Brigade. “Our associates understand the need in our community and they respond in meaningful ways—through our annual giving campaign and volunteer opportunities.”<br />
        <br />
        The donation was made possible by Light Brigade associates who increased their annual donation by nearly 40 percent over 2015. And with the help of AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>, the donation to United Way increased even more.<br />
        <br />
        The theme for this year’s United Way campaign was “Be Someone’s Hero.” The one-week campaign started with a super-hero lunch presentation by Harold Baker and Lydia Landry from United Way of King County. Associates gained a better understanding of their local United Way and the “Fuel Your Future” program designed to connect children to nutritious food throughout the year.    <br />
