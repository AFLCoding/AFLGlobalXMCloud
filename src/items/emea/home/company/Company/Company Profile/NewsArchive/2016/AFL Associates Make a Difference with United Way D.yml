        Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – Several <a href=" /">AFL</a> associates in Belmont, New Hampshire and Lowell, Massachusetts volunteered with <a href="http://www.graniteuw.org/">Granite United Way</a>’s annual Day of Caring that engaged more than 1,600 volunteers from over 115 companies for 100 local nonprofit organizations. AFL volunteers served more than 40 hours with organizations such as LRCCS-Belmont Early Learning Center, Salvation Army Thrift Store, <a href="https://pemiyouthcenter.org/">Pemi Youth Center</a>, Squam Lakes Natural Science Center, New Beginnings, Genesis Behavioral Health and the Carey House.<br />
         <br />
        AFL was a sponsor of the September 16 all-day event, providing $3,000 in support of various project requirements. Two AFL volunteers spent time at <a href="http://www.newbeginningsnh.org/">New Beginnings</a> organizing and cleaning two sheds, weeding and prepping a vegetable garden, as well as repairing and painting a fence. Another volunteer worked a <a href="http://www.nhnature.org/">Squam Lakes Natural Science Center</a> taking out invasive plants in the area. Several other volunteers served by landscaping, painting, installing and more.<br />
         <br />
        AFL Human Resources Manager, Kerrin Corrieri, volunteered with the Pemi Youth Center (PYC), an organization that offers an empowerment program to children 10 years old through senior high school. Its mission is to provide a safe and welcoming environment where youth may gather outside of school and gain a sense of community, belonging and self-esteem. The Center is open to all children and is free of charge. Volunteers served at PYC by cleaning, organizing and painting.<br />
         <br />
        “It was a heart-warming experience – the staff members are clearly passionate about their jobs and care deeply for the youth who participate in their program,” commented Corrieri.<br />
         <br />
        The volunteer project and subsequent donation is known as an <a href=" /Company/Community/ACT-Project ">ACT</a> (AFL Community Team) project in which associates volunteer for an organization and provide either materials or a financial grant to support the project or organization. AFL has an extensive <a href=" /Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a> that also includes grants, sponsorships, scholarships, disaster relief and more.<br />

        Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – Several <a href=" /">AFL</a> associates in Belmont, New Hampshire and Lowell, Massachusetts volunteered with <a href="http://www.graniteuw.org/">Granite United Way</a>’s annual Day of Caring that engaged more than 1,600 volunteers from over 115 companies for 100 local nonprofit organizations. AFL volunteers served more than 40 hours with organizations such as LRCCS-Belmont Early Learning Center, Salvation Army Thrift Store, <a href="https://pemiyouthcenter.org/">Pemi Youth Center</a>, Squam Lakes Natural Science Center, New Beginnings, Genesis Behavioral Health and the Carey House.<br />
         <br />
        AFL was a sponsor of the September 16 all-day event, providing $3,000 in support of various project requirements. Two AFL volunteers spent time at <a href="http://www.newbeginningsnh.org/">New Beginnings</a> organizing and cleaning two sheds, weeding and prepping a vegetable garden, as well as repairing and painting a fence. Another volunteer worked a <a href="http://www.nhnature.org/">Squam Lakes Natural Science Center</a> taking out invasive plants in the area. Several other volunteers served by landscaping, painting, installing and more.<br />
         <br />
        AFL Human Resources Manager, Kerrin Corrieri, volunteered with the Pemi Youth Center (PYC), an organization that offers an empowerment program to children 10 years old through senior high school. Its mission is to provide a safe and welcoming environment where youth may gather outside of school and gain a sense of community, belonging and self-esteem. The Center is open to all children and is free of charge. Volunteers served at PYC by cleaning, organizing and painting.<br />
         <br />
        “It was a heart-warming experience – the staff members are clearly passionate about their jobs and care deeply for the youth who participate in their program,” commented Corrieri.<br />
         <br />
        The volunteer project and subsequent donation is known as an <a href=" /Company/Community/ACT-Project ">ACT</a> (AFL Community Team) project in which associates volunteer for an organization and provide either materials or a financial grant to support the project or organization. AFL has an extensive <a href=" /Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a> that also includes grants, sponsorships, scholarships, disaster relief and more.<br />
