        Spartanburg, SC - Designed with versatility in mind, AFL's LG-55 sealed splice closure offers a variety of solutions including repair and distribution splicing, grounding for Fiber-in-the-Loop applications, and for use as an isolation gap with armored cables. Incorporating a unique cable clamp design which seals the cable, the cover halves of the LG-55 can be removed without disturbing the contents. <br />
        <br />
        The LG-55-SC retains all of the great features of the LG-55, but includes a unique patching system that utilizes pre-terminated SC fiber assemblies or field installable connectors such as the FAST™ SC. The SC version can also be used to facilitate a link between traffic control cabinets and entrance cables, allowing for rapid restoration and minimal damage to a fiber optic cable should an impact disable the cabinet. <br />
        <br />
        Both closures utilize AFL’s Peel & Seal Grommet System™, ensuring a tight fit on various cable diameters while eliminating cumbersome tape and washers.<br />
        <br />
