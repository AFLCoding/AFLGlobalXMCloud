        Vancouver, BC - iPackets International, Inc. ("iPackets" or “Company”) (OTC: IPKL), a developer and provider of wireless communications software and equipment for the mine-safety industry, announced today that the recent successful Mine-1-1 demonstration which was held at one of Brooks Run Mining Company’s coal mines was viewed live, via a satellite simulcast, by representatives of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”).<br />
        <br />
        Utilizing the satellite uplink capability of the MobileNet™ product, a component of the Mine-1-1 offering, the demonstration was simultaneously transmitted live from the coal mine located in the Cowen, W. Virginia area, to the National Mine Health and Safety Academy offices in Beckley, W. Virginia where MSHA’s representatives were available at hand to view the product demonstration, interactively send and receive messages, and establish a one-on-one communications with miners inside the mine.<br />
        <br />
        The overall feedback from the MSHA representatives was extremely positive and appreciated not only the completeness of the Mine-1-1 offering, but also how well the end-to-end system is integrated.<br />
        <br />
        “This is by far one of our best product demonstrations we’ve conducted in the history of our company,” says Naiel Kanno, president and chief executive officer for iPackets. “We have set the bar very high for competitors to match the feature-rich Mine-1-1 capability and demonstrate it effectively.”<br />
        <br />
        Hugh McDavid, President of Mainline Communications, Inc., who was present at the remote demonstration, said, “Not only did the demonstration show definitively that the Mine-1-1 solution provides real-time tracking and monitoring of miners as they move about the mine, as well as two-way voice and data communication with the miners, the remote viewing of the demo showcased the unparalleled flexibility of the system. Nothing else on the market compares with this technology.”<br />
        <br />
        “This was a home run! The Mine-1-1 solution was very adaptable to the environment that it was deployed in and performed great,” stated Miner Lawrence, Director of Project Management and Advanced Solution Systems for AFL Network Services. “Within a few hours we deployed the wireless network, monitored the team below ground as they set the devices, and demonstrated other advanced services over the network without any problems.”<br />
        <br />
        Mr. Lawrence also stated that it was a great team effort. “I’m very proud to be a part of something that will assist with making a safer work environment for the mine workers. It’s amazing when you stop to think about everything that took place – you can see the excitement in the faces of the mine workers standing by.”<br />
        <br />

        Vancouver, BC - iPackets International, Inc. ("iPackets" or “Company”) (OTC: IPKL), a developer and provider of wireless communications software and equipment for the mine-safety industry, announced today that the recent successful Mine-1-1 demonstration which was held at one of Brooks Run Mining Company’s coal mines was viewed live, via a satellite simulcast, by representatives of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”).<br />
        <br />
        Utilizing the satellite uplink capability of the MobileNet™ product, a component of the Mine-1-1 offering, the demonstration was simultaneously transmitted live from the coal mine located in the Cowen, W. Virginia area, to the National Mine Health and Safety Academy offices in Beckley, W. Virginia where MSHA’s representatives were available at hand to view the product demonstration, interactively send and receive messages, and establish a one-on-one communications with miners inside the mine.<br />
        <br />
        The overall feedback from the MSHA representatives was extremely positive and appreciated not only the completeness of the Mine-1-1 offering, but also how well the end-to-end system is integrated.<br />
        <br />
        “This is by far one of our best product demonstrations we’ve conducted in the history of our company,” says Naiel Kanno, president and chief executive officer for iPackets. “We have set the bar very high for competitors to match the feature-rich Mine-1-1 capability and demonstrate it effectively.”<br />
        <br />
        Hugh McDavid, President of Mainline Communications, Inc., who was present at the remote demonstration, said, “Not only did the demonstration show definitively that the Mine-1-1 solution provides real-time tracking and monitoring of miners as they move about the mine, as well as two-way voice and data communication with the miners, the remote viewing of the demo showcased the unparalleled flexibility of the system. Nothing else on the market compares with this technology.”<br />
        <br />
        “This was a home run! The Mine-1-1 solution was very adaptable to the environment that it was deployed in and performed great,” stated Miner Lawrence, Director of Project Management and Advanced Solution Systems for AFL Network Services. “Within a few hours we deployed the wireless network, monitored the team below ground as they set the devices, and demonstrated other advanced services over the network without any problems.”<br />
        <br />
        Mr. Lawrence also stated that it was a great team effort. “I’m very proud to be a part of something that will assist with making a safer work environment for the mine workers. It’s amazing when you stop to think about everything that took place – you can see the excitement in the faces of the mine workers standing by.”<br />
