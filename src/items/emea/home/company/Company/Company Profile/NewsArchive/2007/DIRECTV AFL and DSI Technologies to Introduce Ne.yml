        New York - DIRECTV, the nation's leading digital satellite television service, AFL and DSI Technologies today announced plans to deliver DIRECTV services to a $1.5 billion waterfront development under construction in Brunswick, Georgia. The Liberty Harbor project will be the first to feature DIRECTV's MFH3™ (Multi-Family Housing version 3) technology - a revolutionary distribution system that enables the delivery of all DIRECTV's satellite-delivered content and services using existing in-building distribution wiring.<br />
        <br />
        The IP-based MFH3 technology is a simple distribution platform used to deliver satellite television and other services from a private "on-property" headend facility to each customer dwelling in a multi-dwelling complex or select master planned communities.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to a long list of resort style amenities, Liberty Harbor will feature a community based Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) network that will deliver bundled communications, security and entertainment services to each of the 1,200 condos and 300 single family homes. DSI Technologies, a division of Direct Satellite Installation - a leading DIRECTV dealer, will be the network operator and has selected AFL, a leading product supplier and Fiber-to-the-Home systems integrator, to provide the end-to-end solution.<br />
        <br />
        "By combining the DIRECTV MFH3 technology with DSI's installation expertise and AFL's leading edge fiber products, we're offering an unprecedented suite of services that will further enhance the prestige and appeal of this showcase property," said Daren Benzi, vice president, Sales Development and Strategy, DIRECTV, Inc. "Every Liberty Harbor resident will have access to the full DIRECTV television experience, including our complete line up of industry leading HD programming, DVR, exclusive sports packages, and our new DIRECTV on Demand service that will launch this fall."<br />
        <br />
        "Liberty Harbor offers everything you would expect from a master-planned resort community - waterfront location, yacht club, and a luxury hotel," said Kent Brown - Director, of AFL's Access Solutions group. "By adding Fiber-to-the-Home and MFH3 technology to the list, Liberty Harbor is recognizing consumer demand for bandwidth-hungry services and providing a powerful differentiating amenity. We're pleased to be a part of this extraordinary project."<br />
        <br />
        "With the release of MFH3, DSI Technologies is now able to offer the reliability of a 100% FTTH solution for all broadband services to these types of communities. This includes high speed data, video, voice and security," said John Large of DSI Technologies.<br />

        New York - DIRECTV, the nation's leading digital satellite television service, AFL and DSI Technologies today announced plans to deliver DIRECTV services to a $1.5 billion waterfront development under construction in Brunswick, Georgia. The Liberty Harbor project will be the first to feature DIRECTV's MFH3™ (Multi-Family Housing version 3) technology - a revolutionary distribution system that enables the delivery of all DIRECTV's satellite-delivered content and services using existing in-building distribution wiring.<br />
        <br />
        The IP-based MFH3 technology is a simple distribution platform used to deliver satellite television and other services from a private "on-property" headend facility to each customer dwelling in a multi-dwelling complex or select master planned communities.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to a long list of resort style amenities, Liberty Harbor will feature a community based Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) network that will deliver bundled communications, security and entertainment services to each of the 1,200 condos and 300 single family homes. DSI Technologies, a division of Direct Satellite Installation - a leading DIRECTV dealer, will be the network operator and has selected AFL, a leading product supplier and Fiber-to-the-Home systems integrator, to provide the end-to-end solution.<br />
        <br />
        "By combining the DIRECTV MFH3 technology with DSI's installation expertise and AFL's leading edge fiber products, we're offering an unprecedented suite of services that will further enhance the prestige and appeal of this showcase property," said Daren Benzi, vice president, Sales Development and Strategy, DIRECTV, Inc. "Every Liberty Harbor resident will have access to the full DIRECTV television experience, including our complete line up of industry leading HD programming, DVR, exclusive sports packages, and our new DIRECTV on Demand service that will launch this fall."<br />
        <br />
        "Liberty Harbor offers everything you would expect from a master-planned resort community - waterfront location, yacht club, and a luxury hotel," said Kent Brown - Director, of AFL's Access Solutions group. "By adding Fiber-to-the-Home and MFH3 technology to the list, Liberty Harbor is recognizing consumer demand for bandwidth-hungry services and providing a powerful differentiating amenity. We're pleased to be a part of this extraordinary project."<br />
        <br />
        "With the release of MFH3, DSI Technologies is now able to offer the reliability of a 100% FTTH solution for all broadband services to these types of communities. This includes high speed data, video, voice and security," said John Large of DSI Technologies.<br />
