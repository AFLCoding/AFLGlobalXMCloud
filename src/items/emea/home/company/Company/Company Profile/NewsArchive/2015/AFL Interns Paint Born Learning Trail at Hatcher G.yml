        <p>Spartanburg, SC – As part of AFL’s Month of Service, ten <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> interns gave back to the community by stenciling and painting a <a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/community-impact/bornlearningtrails/">Born Learning Trail</a> at <a href="http://www.hatchergarden.org/">Hatcher Garden</a>, a public botanical garden and woodland preserve in Spartanburg, SC. Flowers, ladybugs, letters and shapes were painted on a 50 foot portion of a sidewalk near the entrance of the Garden. This initiative was started by <a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/community-impact/bornlearningtrails/">United Way of the Piedmont’s</a> Young Leaders Society who secured a grant from the <a href="http://spcf.org/">Spartanburg County Foundation</a> to install 14 trails throughout Spartanburg County.  <br />
        <br />
        The Born Learning Trail consists of a set of ten engaging signs to help parents and caregivers create learning opportunities for young children. These trails show parents and caregivers how to turn everyday activities into learning moments.  Each sign displays fun and interactive games promoting physical activity that exercises a child’s mind and body and has learning activities that parents or caregivers can play with young children at different ages.  <br />
        <br />
        “I am excited that AFL was able to participate in the Born Learning Trails that will be placed throughout the Piedmont area. It shows our commitment to community and the continued support of education.  We are all "Born Learning" and I believe this is another way to educate our youth and future leaders,” said Tomeka Pierce, customer service manager for AFL.<br />
        <br />
        Installing these trails builds awareness around the importance of childhood education while addressing one of the improvements needed to increase kindergarten readiness – improving family and caregiver ability to support social and language development in young children.  Born Learning Trails are used by all in the community.<br />
        <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a> that includes grants, volunteer program, tree planting initiatives and more.

        The Born Learning Trail consists of a set of ten engaging signs to help parents and caregivers create learning opportunities for young children. These trails show parents and caregivers how to turn everyday activities into learning moments.  Each sign displays fun and interactive games promoting physical activity that exercises a child’s mind and body and has learning activities that parents or caregivers can play with young children at different ages.  <br />
        <br />
        “I am excited that AFL was able to participate in the Born Learning Trails that will be placed throughout the Piedmont area. It shows our commitment to community and the continued support of education.  We are all "Born Learning" and I believe this is another way to educate our youth and future leaders,” said Tomeka Pierce, customer service manager for AFL.<br />
        <br />
        Installing these trails builds awareness around the importance of childhood education while addressing one of the improvements needed to increase kindergarten readiness – improving family and caregiver ability to support social and language development in young children.  Born Learning Trails are used by all in the community.<br />
