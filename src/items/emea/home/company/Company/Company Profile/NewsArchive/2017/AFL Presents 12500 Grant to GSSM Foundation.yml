        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> awarded a $12,500 grant to the <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/support/gssm-foundation-board">Governor’s School for Science and Mathematics (GSSM) Foundation</a> in support of its new Spartanburg-based summer camp for middle schoolers, iTEAMS Xtreme: Next Generation, as well as its Business Leadership Network (BLN). The grant is made possible by <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">AFL’s Community Outreach Program</a>, which supports Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education.   <br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/outreach-camps/iteams-xtreme-next-generation">iTEAMS Xtreme: Next Generation</a> is an advanced camp experience designed to introduce rising 7-8 grade students to machinery and concepts through the hands-on exploration of microcontrollers. Up to 60 students from across Spartanburg County will participate in the 2017 camp, and five teachers will be hired and trained to help deliver it. Objectives include introducing diverse populations to studies and careers in computer technology, programming and business; increasing student experience with an understanding of computer technology and its applications; and stimulating innovative thinking and interest in computer technology through project-based group challenges.<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/support/business-leadership-network">Business Leadership Network (BLN)</a> provides support for new and ongoing programs at GSSM and provides residential financial aid for students who cannot afford the annual $2,000 fee, as well as domestic and international research which ranges from $3,000 - $6,000 per student. The Network consists of nearly 200 business, organizations and individuals across the state.<br />
        <br />
        “The U.S. Department of Education projects as much as a 60 percent job increase in STEM fields over the next decade; however, South Carolina continues to lag behind in providing top-tier science and math learning experiences to its students,” explained Kim Bowman, CEO of the GSSM Foundation. “This grant will expose middle schoolers to cutting-edge technologies and inspire them to pursue studies and careers in STEM fields.”  <br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/">GSSM</a> is a two-year, public, residential high school in Hartsville, SC that specializes in the advanced study of STEM. Its mission is to offer the state’s most academically motivated students a unique learning environment that strengthens their ability to think critically, stimulates the joy of learning and fosters the excitement of discovery through hands-on scientific research.<br />
        <br />
        AFL has an extensive Community Outreach Program that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more. For additional information on AFL and its community initiatives, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> awarded a $12,500 grant to the <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/support/gssm-foundation-board">Governor’s School for Science and Mathematics (GSSM) Foundation</a> in support of its new Spartanburg-based summer camp for middle schoolers, iTEAMS Xtreme: Next Generation, as well as its Business Leadership Network (BLN). The grant is made possible by <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">AFL’s Community Outreach Program</a>, which supports Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education.   <br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/outreach-camps/iteams-xtreme-next-generation">iTEAMS Xtreme: Next Generation</a> is an advanced camp experience designed to introduce rising 7-8 grade students to machinery and concepts through the hands-on exploration of microcontrollers. Up to 60 students from across Spartanburg County will participate in the 2017 camp, and five teachers will be hired and trained to help deliver it. Objectives include introducing diverse populations to studies and careers in computer technology, programming and business; increasing student experience with an understanding of computer technology and its applications; and stimulating innovative thinking and interest in computer technology through project-based group challenges.<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/support/business-leadership-network">Business Leadership Network (BLN)</a> provides support for new and ongoing programs at GSSM and provides residential financial aid for students who cannot afford the annual $2,000 fee, as well as domestic and international research which ranges from $3,000 - $6,000 per student. The Network consists of nearly 200 business, organizations and individuals across the state.<br />
        <br />
        “The U.S. Department of Education projects as much as a 60 percent job increase in STEM fields over the next decade; however, South Carolina continues to lag behind in providing top-tier science and math learning experiences to its students,” explained Kim Bowman, CEO of the GSSM Foundation. “This grant will expose middle schoolers to cutting-edge technologies and inspire them to pursue studies and careers in STEM fields.”  <br />
        <br />
