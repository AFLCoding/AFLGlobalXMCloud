        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> presented the South Carolina Governor’s School for Science and Mathematics (GSSM) Foundation a $10,000 grant to support its GoSciTech program, a summer camp that provides eighth, ninth and 10th grade students with a unique, hands-on experience in the fields of science and technology. In 2012, the program increased participants by 32 percent after rebranding. Along with a new name, GoSciTech updated their courses and equipment to keep up with today’s tech-savvy youth.<br />
        <br />
        “At GoSciTech, students choose from special-interest courses designed to appeal to the teenage mind, taught by industry professionals, distinguished faculty from SC colleges and universities and from GSSM. Campers test blood samples for forensic analysis, build robots, design Web applications, explore SC ecology and delve into pharmaceutical chemistry, among other adventures,” stated Kim Bowman, chief executive officer for GSSM. “GoSciTech challenges motivated students who are interested in exploring cutting-edge technologies and scientific applications through interactive lab activities and one-of-a-kind field trips.”<br />
        <br />
        GSSM strives to prepare the younger generation for an evolving job market and knowledge-based economy. GoSciTech encourages students to consider a future in STEM fields by exposing them to innovative technologies, offering high-quality courses developed by university professors and experts, and discussing possible career paths.<br />
        <br />
        “As growth in science and technology jobs increase, STEM skills are essential,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “We are excited to be a part of GSSM’s endeavor to help cultivate tomorrow’s workforce.” <br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> presented the South Carolina Governor’s School for Science and Mathematics (GSSM) Foundation a $10,000 grant to support its GoSciTech program, a summer camp that provides eighth, ninth and 10th grade students with a unique, hands-on experience in the fields of science and technology. In 2012, the program increased participants by 32 percent after rebranding. Along with a new name, GoSciTech updated their courses and equipment to keep up with today’s tech-savvy youth.<br />
        <br />
        “At GoSciTech, students choose from special-interest courses designed to appeal to the teenage mind, taught by industry professionals, distinguished faculty from SC colleges and universities and from GSSM. Campers test blood samples for forensic analysis, build robots, design Web applications, explore SC ecology and delve into pharmaceutical chemistry, among other adventures,” stated Kim Bowman, chief executive officer for GSSM. “GoSciTech challenges motivated students who are interested in exploring cutting-edge technologies and scientific applications through interactive lab activities and one-of-a-kind field trips.”<br />
        <br />
        GSSM strives to prepare the younger generation for an evolving job market and knowledge-based economy. GoSciTech encourages students to consider a future in STEM fields by exposing them to innovative technologies, offering high-quality courses developed by university professors and experts, and discussing possible career paths.<br />
        <br />
        “As growth in science and technology jobs increase, STEM skills are essential,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “We are excited to be a part of GSSM’s endeavor to help cultivate tomorrow’s workforce.” <br />
