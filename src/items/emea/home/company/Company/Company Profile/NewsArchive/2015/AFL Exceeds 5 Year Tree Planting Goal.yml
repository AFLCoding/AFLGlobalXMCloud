        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> announces it exceeded its 5-year goal of planting 12,000 trees by 2015. The program, called <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/Take-Root.aspx">Take Root</a>, was implemented in 2005 and had a goal of planting 5,000 trees by 2010. Having exceeded that goal, AFL set a loftier goal—to plant 12,000 within the next five years—by 2015. Within the last five years, AFL has planted 13,708 trees around the world. Adding in the previous 5-year total, AFL has planted nearly 18,800 trees.</p>
        <p>Over the past ten years, AFL locations around the world have hosted Take Root events on its campuses, at national parks and schools, to commemorate special events or in support of nonprofit organizations. Mostly recently three AFL locations participated in the program.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spartanburg, SC – AFL provided more than 1,300 small pine trees from the Arbor Day Foundation to local intermediate school children and teachers in celebration of Arbor Day in South Carolina.</li>
            <li>Monterrey Mexico – AFL associates and interns participated in an Adopt-a-Tree campaign to find homes for 100 Encino Siempreverde (Quercus Virginiana), a native tree.</li>
            <li>Belmont, NH and Lowell, MA – AFL associates planted trees at the Belmont Early Learning Center and in City of Methuen, Massachusetts. Additionally, all associates in those two locations received a tree to take home and plant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AFL’s Take Root program will evolve in 2016 to include environmental initiatives such as recycling for a cause, partnering with local parks and continued planting of trees and shrubs.</p>
        <p>AFL has an extensive <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants to nonprofit organizations, encourages associates to serve in their communities, provides disaster relief and sponsors various events in the community, plus much more.

        <p>Over the past ten years, AFL locations around the world have hosted Take Root events on its campuses, at national parks and schools, to commemorate special events or in support of nonprofit organizations. Mostly recently three AFL locations participated in the program.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spartanburg, SC – AFL provided more than 1,300 small pine trees from the Arbor Day Foundation to local intermediate school children and teachers in celebration of Arbor Day in South Carolina.</li>
            <li>Monterrey Mexico – AFL associates and interns participated in an Adopt-a-Tree campaign to find homes for 100 Encino Siempreverde (Quercus Virginiana), a native tree.</li>
            <li>Belmont, NH and Lowell, MA – AFL associates planted trees at the Belmont Early Learning Center and in City of Methuen, Massachusetts. Additionally, all associates in those two locations received a tree to take home and plant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AFL’s Take Root program will evolve in 2016 to include environmental initiatives such as recycling for a cause, partnering with local parks and continued planting of trees and shrubs.</p>
        <p>AFL has an extensive <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants to nonprofit organizations, encourages associates to serve in their communities, provides disaster relief and sponsors various events in the community, plus much more.
