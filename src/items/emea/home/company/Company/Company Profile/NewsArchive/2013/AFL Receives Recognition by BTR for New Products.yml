        Spartanburg, SC – Several new <a href=" /">AFL</a> products were recognized by the <em>Broadband Technology Report</em> (BTR) Diamond Technology Reviews (“the Diamonds”) awards program, receiving high honors across the board. This program recognizes top products and solutions available to the broadband-cable industry, and is judged by an esteemed panel of MSO-engineering experts as well as highly regarded industry consultants. AFL’s WDM900 Lightwave Test Set, FOCIS PRO, Fujikura 70S and LL-580 enclosure all received recognition.<br />
        <br />
        One of AFL’s newer products, the <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/xWDM-Test/WDM900-Lightwave-Test-Set ">WDM900 Lightwave Test Set</a> simplifies the maintenance and troubleshooting of in-service metro-E, mobile backhauls and headend-to-hub distribution links. Like an OSA, its WDM900 Health Meter display shows each and every DWDM channel present, but unlike an OSA, it uses a Health factor to compare the three critical operating parameters of each channel to user defined pass/fail criteria.<br />
        <br />
        The NOYES® <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-PRO-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-System ">FOCIS PRO Fiber Optic Connector Inspection System</a> is a second-generation automated inspection and analysis solution engineered to meet the needs of outside plant use. Consisting of a rugged palm-sized touchscreen tablet, task-specific automatic inspection/analysis algorithms and a high resolution video probe, the FOCIS PRO system enables broadband operators to achieve the fiber optic connector integrity needed to insure that residential and business customers receive reliable and consistent delivery of service without the need for expensive call backs and truck rolls.<br />
        <br />
        Next, the <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers-Single-Fiber/Fujikura-70S-Fusion-Splicer ">Fujikura 70S</a> core alignment fusion splicer, one of the newer members of the world’s most proven and technologically-advanced <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing ">family of splicing products</a> from Fujikura, offers several enhanced features including a motorized wind protector and tube heater with the world’s fastest heating times; long-life electrodes provide 3,000 splices; and a high resolution, 4.73-inch color LCD monitor with 300X fiber magnification for improved visibility in low-light  conditions.<br />
        <br />
        And lastly, AFL’s <a href=" /Products/Fiber-Outside-Plant/LightLink-Fiber-Enclosures-and-Pedestals/LightLink-580-AT-Optical-Splicing-and-Distribution ">LL-580 optical splicing and distribution enclosure</a> addresses the need to patch, patch and splice, express cut/drop fibers and manage wavelengths (WDM or splitters) in a single enclosure. Designed for organizing, splicing and interconnecting fibers, the enclosure is an ideal fit for business service hand-offs, MDU distribution and connectivity, cellular backhaul and other commercial services that require weather-proof field connectivity.<br />
        <br />

        Spartanburg, SC – Several new <a href=" /">AFL</a> products were recognized by the <em>Broadband Technology Report</em> (BTR) Diamond Technology Reviews (“the Diamonds”) awards program, receiving high honors across the board. This program recognizes top products and solutions available to the broadband-cable industry, and is judged by an esteemed panel of MSO-engineering experts as well as highly regarded industry consultants. AFL’s WDM900 Lightwave Test Set, FOCIS PRO, Fujikura 70S and LL-580 enclosure all received recognition.<br />
        <br />
        One of AFL’s newer products, the <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/xWDM-Test/WDM900-Lightwave-Test-Set ">WDM900 Lightwave Test Set</a> simplifies the maintenance and troubleshooting of in-service metro-E, mobile backhauls and headend-to-hub distribution links. Like an OSA, its WDM900 Health Meter display shows each and every DWDM channel present, but unlike an OSA, it uses a Health factor to compare the three critical operating parameters of each channel to user defined pass/fail criteria.<br />
        <br />
        The NOYES® <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-PRO-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-System ">FOCIS PRO Fiber Optic Connector Inspection System</a> is a second-generation automated inspection and analysis solution engineered to meet the needs of outside plant use. Consisting of a rugged palm-sized touchscreen tablet, task-specific automatic inspection/analysis algorithms and a high resolution video probe, the FOCIS PRO system enables broadband operators to achieve the fiber optic connector integrity needed to insure that residential and business customers receive reliable and consistent delivery of service without the need for expensive call backs and truck rolls.<br />
        <br />
        Next, the <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers-Single-Fiber/Fujikura-70S-Fusion-Splicer ">Fujikura 70S</a> core alignment fusion splicer, one of the newer members of the world’s most proven and technologically-advanced <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing ">family of splicing products</a> from Fujikura, offers several enhanced features including a motorized wind protector and tube heater with the world’s fastest heating times; long-life electrodes provide 3,000 splices; and a high resolution, 4.73-inch color LCD monitor with 300X fiber magnification for improved visibility in low-light  conditions.<br />
        <br />
        And lastly, AFL’s <a href=" /Products/Fiber-Outside-Plant/LightLink-Fiber-Enclosures-and-Pedestals/LightLink-580-AT-Optical-Splicing-and-Distribution ">LL-580 optical splicing and distribution enclosure</a> addresses the need to patch, patch and splice, express cut/drop fibers and manage wavelengths (WDM or splitters) in a single enclosure. Designed for organizing, splicing and interconnecting fibers, the enclosure is an ideal fit for business service hand-offs, MDU distribution and connectivity, cellular backhaul and other commercial services that require weather-proof field connectivity.<br />
