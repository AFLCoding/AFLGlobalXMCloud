        Spartanburg, SC and North Grafton, MA – Associates from <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Verrillon.aspx">Verrillon division</a> partnered with <a href="http://www.habitatmwgw.org/">Habitat for Humanity MetroWest/Greater Worcester</a> to assist in the completion of a new residential duplex home. Known as an <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/ACT-Project.aspx">ACT</a> (AFL Community Team) project, eight AFL volunteers removed debris, cleaned floors and windows, installed bathroom cabinets and cleaned bathtubs. At the end of the project, ACT volunteers presented a $2,000 grant to Habitat for Humanity made possible by AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>.<br />
        <br />
        “I can’t fully express how good we felt at the completion of the project,” said Karen Lombardi, AFL office manager. “It was hard work, but we all had fun doing it together.”<br />
         <br />
        The 4,700 square foot home features two separate units with three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms each and will house two single mothers and their children. The duplex is expected to be completed in March.<br />
         <br />
        “AFL has an extensive community outreach program and projects such as these are some of the most impactful, not only for the organization but also for our associates,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Giving back is part of our culture. Our associates are committed to making a difference in the lives of others.”<br />
         <br />
        AFL’s Community Outreach Program consists of grants, employee engagement projects, tree planting initiatives, disaster relief and more. To learn more about AFL, Verrillon and the Community Outreach Program, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />

        Spartanburg, SC and North Grafton, MA – Associates from <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Verrillon.aspx">Verrillon division</a> partnered with <a href="http://www.habitatmwgw.org/">Habitat for Humanity MetroWest/Greater Worcester</a> to assist in the completion of a new residential duplex home. Known as an <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/ACT-Project.aspx">ACT</a> (AFL Community Team) project, eight AFL volunteers removed debris, cleaned floors and windows, installed bathroom cabinets and cleaned bathtubs. At the end of the project, ACT volunteers presented a $2,000 grant to Habitat for Humanity made possible by AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>.<br />
        <br />
        “I can’t fully express how good we felt at the completion of the project,” said Karen Lombardi, AFL office manager. “It was hard work, but we all had fun doing it together.”<br />
         <br />
        The 4,700 square foot home features two separate units with three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms each and will house two single mothers and their children. The duplex is expected to be completed in March.<br />
         <br />
        “AFL has an extensive community outreach program and projects such as these are some of the most impactful, not only for the organization but also for our associates,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Giving back is part of our culture. Our associates are committed to making a difference in the lives of others.”<br />
         <br />
