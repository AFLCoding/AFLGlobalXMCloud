        Spartanburg, SC – Each year, AFL associates around the world participate in a Month of Service, engaging in projects that support communities and invest in the future. Held throughout the month of April, seven AFL locations volunteered at organizations to support and better their community. These volunteer projects included food and clothing drives, clean up, restoration and many more projects to reach those in need.  <br />
        <br />
        “As one of our core values, community engagement is in our DNA,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “All over the world, AFL associates on six continents understand the importance of volunteerism and are eager to participate in their community. Each year I am amazed at how committed associates are to giving back to the greater community.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL associates in Spartanburg volunteered their time on two Habitat for Humanity® CEO Builds, helping on homes for local low income families. At both events, associates painted, installed trim, shelving and door hardware as well as completed unfinished interior and exterior work. Alongside participating in Habitat for Humanity, associates also held two collection drives, donating gently used purses, scarves, jewelry and accessories to “Purses for a Purpose” and donating gently used or new books to “Leadership Spartanburg” to support several nonprofit organizations in the area.<br />
        <br />
        A team of AFL associates in Duluth, Georgia donated 15 shoeboxes to United Way’s Shoebox Project, a project in support of homeless women and children. The shoeboxes contained many basic supplies, including soap, hair care products, socks, sun protection and more.<br />
        <br />
        AFL associates in Belmont, NH and Lowell, MA volunteered at the Lowell Transitional Living Center (LTLC) and The Belknap House, organizations that serve homeless women and children in their communities.

        <br />
        In Australia and New Zealand, AFL locations partnered with the Fiji Seniors Club to serve their broader community by holding a clothing drive for their Fijian neighbors whose community has been devastated by the recent cyclone. Associates donated 330 pounds of containers full of clothing, blankets, books and stationery.<br />
        <br />
        AFL Europe locations volunteered their time and served their local communities through various causes. Associates in Milton Keynes, UK volunteered at a local food bank, unloading boxes of donations, organizing food by date and distributing food to those in need. Associates in Brno, Czech Republic spent a Saturday cleaning the quarry in Brno, a popular area where many in the community spend their free time.<br />
        <br />
        A team of 22 AFL associates from the Mexico location participated in the Metroplex Park Rehabilitation project, painting and restoring waste cans, benches and playground equipment.<br />
