        Spartanburg, SC – Several <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> associates along with family and friends gathered at <a href="https://www.greenville.k12.sc.us/hughes/">Hughes Academy of Science and Technology</a> to plant 21 trees as part of AFL’s annual Arbor Day celebration. The project was completed in partnership with <a href="http://www.treesgreenville.org/">TreesGreenville</a>, an organization whose mission is to plant, promote and protect trees in Greenville County, SC. TreesGreenville was also the recipient of a $2,000 conservation grant made possible by <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">AFL’s Community Outreach Program</a>.<br />
        <br />
        “Our volunteers bring small children to this family-friendly project,” explained Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “It’s a great opportunity to teach youth the importance of conservation and giving back to the community.”<br />
         <br />
        Seventeen families and a total of 40 volunteers—mostly children—dug large holes for a variety of trees and then planted, fertilized and watered them around the grounds of Hughes Academy. As the trees grow they will provide a constant source of shade, help save energy and support wildlife in the area.<br />
         <br />
        AFL’s conservation initiative includes planting trees, recycling, litter pick-up and more. Over the past 10 years, AFL has planted over 20,000 trees, reduced global electricity use by 14 percent, cut natural gas consumption by 42 percent and lowered water use by 11 percent.   <br />
         <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program </a>that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more. For additional information on AFL and its community initiatives, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
