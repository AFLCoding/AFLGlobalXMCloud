        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a> achieved its certification for COR, a Certificate of Recognition issued by the <a href="http://www.scsaonline.ca/">Saskatchewan Construction Safety Association</a>. The certification is a critical component of AFL’s value proposition in the telecommunications services sector across Canada and globally, demonstrating that AFL continues to prioritize the <a href="/Company/Environment-Health-and-Safety/Safety-Record">safety</a> and well-being of its associates, clients and the general public while delivering a broad portfolio of telecom service capabilities. <a href="http://www.scsaonline.ca/programs/cor">COR</a> is the national standard for certification in the Canadian construction industry and provides companies with the knowledge and tools to develop an effective safety and health management system to reduce incidents and associated human and financial costs.<br />
        <br />
        Brian Brown, AFL Safety Manager, led the efforts for certification and accomplished the following:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Completed four mandatory courses including Safety Management, Leadership for Safety Excellence, Safety Auditor Training and Train the Trainer/Basic Training Techniques. In addition to these courses, Brian completed another 13 courses to obtain the designation of Construction Health and Safety Officer (CHSO).</li>
            <li>Developed and implemented a safety program over a period of 10 months with guidance and support from COR Safety Advisors.</li>
            <li>Passed an external health and safety audit as COR Safety Auditors observed AFL during operation. Associates were interviewed and documentation was provided that ensured technicians were properly trained. Safety Auditors observed AFL in operation and interviewed associates to learn if they were aware of AFL’s safety program.</li>
        </ul>
        Although COR certification is nationally recognized in Canada, certification must be attained in each province or territory in which the company is working. Currently, AFL provides services coast to coast in Canada through its 1,200 associates and maintaining this  certification requires the completion of a satisfactory internal audit annually. Moreover, every third year, COR auditors conduct an external audit.<br />
        <br />
        Brown commented, “Identifying negatives and correcting those areas keeps our health and safety procedures top of mind for everyone. At AFL, safety is a priority and we intend to strive for excellence.”<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a> achieved its certification for COR, a Certificate of Recognition issued by the <a href="http://www.scsaonline.ca/">Saskatchewan Construction Safety Association</a>. The certification is a critical component of AFL’s value proposition in the telecommunications services sector across Canada and globally, demonstrating that AFL continues to prioritize the <a href="/Company/Environment-Health-and-Safety/Safety-Record">safety</a> and well-being of its associates, clients and the general public while delivering a broad portfolio of telecom service capabilities. <a href="http://www.scsaonline.ca/programs/cor">COR</a> is the national standard for certification in the Canadian construction industry and provides companies with the knowledge and tools to develop an effective safety and health management system to reduce incidents and associated human and financial costs.<br />
        <br />
        Brian Brown, AFL Safety Manager, led the efforts for certification and accomplished the following:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Completed four mandatory courses including Safety Management, Leadership for Safety Excellence, Safety Auditor Training and Train the Trainer/Basic Training Techniques. In addition to these courses, Brian completed another 13 courses to obtain the designation of Construction Health and Safety Officer (CHSO).</li>
            <li>Developed and implemented a safety program over a period of 10 months with guidance and support from COR Safety Advisors.</li>
            <li>Passed an external health and safety audit as COR Safety Auditors observed AFL during operation. Associates were interviewed and documentation was provided that ensured technicians were properly trained. Safety Auditors observed AFL in operation and interviewed associates to learn if they were aware of AFL’s safety program.</li>
        </ul>
        Although COR certification is nationally recognized in Canada, certification must be attained in each province or territory in which the company is working. Currently, AFL provides services coast to coast in Canada through its 1,200 associates and maintaining this  certification requires the completion of a satisfactory internal audit annually. Moreover, every third year, COR auditors conduct an external audit.<br />
        <br />
        Brown commented, “Identifying negatives and correcting those areas keeps our health and safety procedures top of mind for everyone. At AFL, safety is a priority and we intend to strive for excellence.”<br />
