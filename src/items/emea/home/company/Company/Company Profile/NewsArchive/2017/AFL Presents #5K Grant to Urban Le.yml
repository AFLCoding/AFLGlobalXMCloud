        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international fiber optic cable and accessories manufacturer headquartered in Duncan, SC, presented a $5,000 grant to the <a href="http://urbanleagueupstate.org/">Urban League of the Upstate (ULUS)</a>, an organization committed to educating and equipping students thereby transforming generations. The grant is part of AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> and will aid in a new facet to the Fiber Optics Certification and Construction and Trade Skills (CAST) training programs by providing a soft-skills class for Greenville and Spartanburg high school students.<br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/2017_Grant_UrbanLeague_media.aspx" target="_blank"></a><br />
        The <a href="http://urbanleagueupstate.org/">Urban League</a> is the only organization in the state to offer Fiber Optics Certification approved by the <a href="http://www.thefoa.org/">Fiber Optics Association</a> (FOA), and one of few that offer CAST training. The soft-skills training program will provide 50 high school students a platform to receive FOA or CAST certifications.<br />
         <br />
        “Our program participants are generally from low-income households. For graduating high school students, many would be considered a traditionally at-risk student due to low income levels,” explained Emily Cox, development manager for ULUS. “For this group of potential program participants, we will first work to make sure they complete high school, and then help them define their career path prior to applying for the fiber optics or CAST certification classes.”<br />
         <br />
        The program is provided free of charge to all who are accepted. Acceptance will go to those most in need who are qualified for the program and fully vested in having a career as a fiber optics technician or a CAST employee.<br />
         <br />
