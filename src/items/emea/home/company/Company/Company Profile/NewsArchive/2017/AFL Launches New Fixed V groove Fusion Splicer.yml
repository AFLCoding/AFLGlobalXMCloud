        Spartanburg, SC – April 25, 2017 – <a href="http://www.afl%27/">AFL</a> is launching a new version of the Fujikura 12S, the world’s smallest, lightest and most portable fusion splicer. The new <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=750EE63900404AB2B3DDC1AB825DD815&_z=z">Fujikura 12S-C fixed V-groove fusion splicer</a> retains the same high quality and workmanship of the Fujikura 12S, but is available with sheath clamps instead of fiber holders, reducing splice time.<br />
         <br />
        “Fujikura continues to provide new and innovative fusion splicing products to the market and the model 12S-C continues that tradition,” explained Greg Pickeral, splicer product & operations manager for AFL. “The addition of sheath clamps to our most portable splicer model provides greater utility for those customers primarily installing splice on connectors or wishing to avoid managing the extra parts required for fiber holder operation.”<br />
         <br />
        Both the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers-Single-Fiber/Fujikura-12S-Fusion-Splicer.aspx">Fujikura 12S and 12S-C</a> incorporate a rugged chassis that provides shock, dust and moisture protection while the large monitor that provides a clear image, even in bright sunlight, for evaluating splice quality. The long electrode life minimizes downtime for replacement and stabilization and the two-camera observation system provides accurate fiber alignment and loss estimation calculations.<br />
         <br />
        Even with its small size, these fusion splicers support the most challenging environments. The transit case easily coverts to a workstation and provides multiple work tray options. Both versions are fully compatible with the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E45B502DDFA5425DB92A83FA29EF2870&_z=z">FUSEConnect®</a> line of fusion installable connectors.<br />
         <br />
