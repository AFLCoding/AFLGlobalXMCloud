        Last week, members of AFL’s Finance, Information Technology and Human Resources teams based in Duncan, SC, conducted an all-day volunteer project at Cancer Association of Spartanburg and Cherokee Counties in downtown Spartanburg. Part of United Way of the Piedmont’s Week of Caring and AFL’s ACT initiative, volunteers contributed in a number of ways including sorting, filing, cleaning and overall organization of materials.<br />
        <br />
        After completing the on-site work, team members presented The Cancer Association of Spartanburg and Cherokee Counties with a check for $3,000. The grant is part of the AFL Community Team (ACT) project which combines three or more hours of service with a grant for that organization.<br />
        <br />
        “We are incredibly grateful for the work that AFL did. Having the extra hands available made such a difference for our clients and our staff,” stated Glaydeane S. Lee, executive director for the Cancer Association. “The donation was truly a surprise. We intend to use it for transportation initiatives which will allow our clients to get gasoline so they can travel to their treatments.”<br />
        <br />
        The Cancer Association of Spartanburg and Cherokee Counties is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to providing quality of life services to area residents facing the challenges of cancer in our communities through screenings, education and direct services. The Cancer Association provides critical supplies to clients with cancer, including nutritional supplements, bras and breast prostheses, ostomy supplies, home care supplies, wigs, gas cards for treatment transportation, help with cancer medication costs, loan of hospital equipment and much more.<br />
        <br />
        Last year, AFL adopted cancer initiatives as a cause to support worldwide. In honor of volunteers at AFL, the company presented a check for $8,000 in July to the Cancer Support Community, an international nonprofit dedicated to providing support, education and hope to people affected by cancer. In October, AFL will support The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's “Light the Night” Walk, and more initiatives are underway.<br />
