        Vancouver, BC - iPackets International, Inc. ("iPackets" or “Company”) (OTC: IPKL), a developer and provider of wireless communications software and equipment for the mine-safety industry, is pleased to announce that the Company along with its two partners, AFL Network Services’ Enterprise Division (“AFL”), and Mainline Communications (“Mainline”), have successfully demonstrated the Mine-1-1 comprehensive wireless mine-safety product offering to Brooks Run Mining Co., LLC (“Brooks”), a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources (NYSE:ANR) that owns and operates 64 coal mines in the United States.<br />
        <br />
        The products demonstrated were iPackets’ iPMine solution, and AFL’s network services including their third generation of the MobileNet™ product, remote video surveillance, and Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) capability. The successful demo, facilitated by Mainline, was conducted on-site at one of Brooks’ 33 coal mines in the United States.<br />
        <br />
        “We are extremely pleased that within a few weeks from announcing the Mine-1-1 offering for the U.S. market, our partner Mainline was able to quickly arrange for a demo of this magnitude at a large coal operator in the U.S.,” says Naiel Kanno, president and CEO for iPackets.<br />
        <br />
        Hugh McDavid, President of Mainline, was enthusiastic about the successful demonstration, saying, “We have known all along that the Mine-1-1 solution is cutting edge technology that will save lives. The success of the demonstration proved that and has already generated a lot of discussion and excitement in the mining industry. Since mine safety is so important, the management at Alpha Resources, Inc. and Brooks Run should be congratulated for their willingness to give us the opportunity to show them and miners just how well the system works.”     <br />
        <br />
        “This was a very exciting and productive test and demonstration,” stated Miner Lawrence, Director of Project Management and Advanced Solution Systems for AFL Network Services. “The mine workers were enthused about the new system –the way it works and all that could be accomplished with this single solution. It’s great to be part of a team that is focused on providing safer working conditions within the mining community. We look forward to our continued partnership.”<br />

The successful demo, facilitated by Mainline, was conducted on-site at one of Brooks’ 33 coal mines in the United States.<br />
        <br />
        “We are extremely pleased that within a few weeks from announcing the Mine-1-1 offering for the U.S. market, our partner Mainline was able to quickly arrange for a demo of this magnitude at a large coal operator in the U.S.,” says Naiel Kanno, president and CEO for iPackets.<br />
        <br />
        Hugh McDavid, President of Mainline, was enthusiastic about the successful demonstration, saying, “We have known all along that the Mine-1-1 solution is cutting edge technology that will save lives. The success of the demonstration proved that and has already generated a lot of discussion and excitement in the mining industry. Since mine safety is so important, the management at Alpha Resources, Inc. and Brooks Run should be congratulated for their willingness to give us the opportunity to show them and miners just how well the system works.”     <br />
        <br />
        “This was a very exciting and productive test and demonstration,” stated Miner Lawrence, Director of Project Management and Advanced Solution Systems for AFL Network Services. “The mine workers were enthused about the new system –the way it works and all that could be accomplished with this single solution. It’s great to be part of a team that is focused on providing safer working conditions within the mining community. We look forward to our continued partnership.”<br />
