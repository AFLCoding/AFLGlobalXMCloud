        About Hope Center for Children<br />
        Hope Center for Children, formerly the Children Shelter of the Upstate and Ellen Hines Smith Girls’ Home, exists to build stable, healthy families and provide children a safe place from abuse and neglect.  HCFC has five primary programs that work toward this goal; two programs serve families with increased risk of abuse or neglect, two provide around-the-clock care for children who are victims of abuse or neglect and one program works with youth at risk of homelessness. In the past 12 months, the center has served 2,393 children in our community.
