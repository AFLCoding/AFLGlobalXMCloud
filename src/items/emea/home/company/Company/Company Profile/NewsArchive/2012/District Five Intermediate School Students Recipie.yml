        Spartanburg, SC – AFL partnered with District Five Schools and provided a longleaf pine tree in honor of fifth grade students in the area. Over 600 trees were donated to students at Beech Springs Intermediate and Berry Shoals Intermediate in Duncan, South Carolina. The initiative is part of AFL’s Take Root program which has a goal to plant 12,000 trees in five years (by 2015).<br />
        <br />
        "Our students are very aware of the social and community issues that surround them. They are also environmentally conscious and committed to helping our environment through activities such as recycling,” said Michael Powell, Berry Shoals Intermediate Principal. “Our fifth graders were very excited and thankful when they learned that they would each be receiving their own tree to plant at home. Many of them quickly made the connection between planting the trees and helping our environment."<br />
        <br />
        Daniel, a student at Berry Shoals, stated: "I think today was fantastic!  I will celebrate Arbor Day by planting my tree to make the Earth better."<br />
        <br />
        AFL recently exceeded its goal of planting/providing 5,000 trees by 2010. The new goal accounts for one tree per associate per year for five years and equates to 12,000 trees. AFL hosts Take Root events on its campuses both domestic and international and with various organizations in communities where AFL has operations.<br />
         <br />
        "Education provides a substantial part of the root system each child needs to be a productive citizen in life. With these trees, students will in a sense get to experience planting and nurturing new life,” said Chad Dowden, Beech Springs Intermediate Principal. “As they replace one of the many trees that have been cut down over the years, they get to watch the one provided to them by AFL grow to maturity. As educators, we hope that ALL of our students will thrive in school and then mature into adults which contribute positively to society." <br />
