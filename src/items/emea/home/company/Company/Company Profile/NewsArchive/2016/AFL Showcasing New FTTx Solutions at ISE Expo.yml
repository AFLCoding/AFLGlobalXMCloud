        Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /Home ">AFL</a>, an industry-leading provider of fiber optic products, engineering expertise and integrated services, is featuring an end-to-end FTTx solution at the 2016 <a href="http://iseexpo.com/">ISE Expo</a>, Booth #1024. New products include the <a href=" /Products/Fiber-Outside-Plant/TITAN-RTD-FTTx-System ">TITAN RTD FTTx system</a> and <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/Singlemode-OTDRs-Fault-Locators-Telco-Broadband/FlexScan-OTDR ">FlexScan PON OTDRs</a>.<br />
        <br />
        The TITAN RTD FTTx System product set allows for quick and easy subscriber connections anywhere in the OSP network—underground, in pedestals, on poles or on aerial strand or <a href=" /Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/ADSS ">ADSS</a> cables. The sealed and rugged design of both the <a href=" /Products/Fiber-Outside-Plant/TITAN-RTD-FTTx-System/TITAN-RTD-Multiport-Terminal ">TITAN RTD Multiport</a> and <a href=" /Products/Fiber-Outside-Plant/TITAN-RTD-FTTx-System/AFL-TRIDENT-Hardened-Drop-Cables ">AFL TRIDENT connector</a> allow for long-term reliability cables. Unlike other solutions in the market, the TITAN RTD Multiport is designed to allow for re-entry to ease connector repair in case of damage incurred in the field.<br />
        <br />
        AFL representatives will also demo the new <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/Singlemode-OTDRs-Fault-Locators-Telco-Broadband/FlexScan-OTDR ">FlexScan PON OTDR</a>. The FS200-304 PON OTDR offers 1310, 1550 and 1650 nm OTDR testing to verify and troubleshoot both in-service and out-of-service FTTH PONs. The FS200-300 FlexScan supports 1310 and 1550 nm out-of-service testing for both PON and point-to-point networks. All FlexScan OTDRs include AFL’s SmartAuto™ multi-pulse acquisition, enabling users to detect closely spaced events before a PON splitter while still testing effectively through the splitter. FlexScan OTDRs also display test results in both AFL’s icon-based LinkMap® view and OTDR trace view, allowing users to quickly and easily locate faults and identify necessary corrective action.<br />
        <br />
        These products along with <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment ">Fujikura fusion splicers</a>, <a href=" /Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant ">fiber management solutions</a> and <a href=" /Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable ">fiber optic cable</a> will be showcased.

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /Home ">AFL</a>, an industry-leading provider of fiber optic products, engineering expertise and integrated services, is featuring an end-to-end FTTx solution at the 2016 <a href="http://iseexpo.com/">ISE Expo</a>, Booth #1024. New products include the <a href=" /Products/Fiber-Outside-Plant/TITAN-RTD-FTTx-System ">TITAN RTD FTTx system</a> and <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/Singlemode-OTDRs-Fault-Locators-Telco-Broadband/FlexScan-OTDR ">FlexScan PON OTDRs</a>.<br />
        <br />
        The TITAN RTD FTTx System product set allows for quick and easy subscriber connections anywhere in the OSP network—underground, in pedestals, on poles or on aerial strand or <a href=" /Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/ADSS ">ADSS</a> cables. The sealed and rugged design of both the <a href=" /Products/Fiber-Outside-Plant/TITAN-RTD-FTTx-System/TITAN-RTD-Multiport-Terminal ">TITAN RTD Multiport</a> and <a href=" /Products/Fiber-Outside-Plant/TITAN-RTD-FTTx-System/AFL-TRIDENT-Hardened-Drop-Cables ">AFL TRIDENT connector</a> allow for long-term reliability cables. Unlike other solutions in the market, the TITAN RTD Multiport is designed to allow for re-entry to ease connector repair in case of damage incurred in the field.<br />
        <br />
        AFL representatives will also demo the new <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/Singlemode-OTDRs-Fault-Locators-Telco-Broadband/FlexScan-OTDR ">FlexScan PON OTDR</a>. The FS200-304 PON OTDR offers 1310, 1550 and 1650 nm OTDR testing to verify and troubleshoot both in-service and out-of-service FTTH PONs. The FS200-300 FlexScan supports 1310 and 1550 nm out-of-service testing for both PON and point-to-point networks. All FlexScan OTDRs include AFL’s SmartAuto™ multi-pulse acquisition, enabling users to detect closely spaced events before a PON splitter while still testing effectively through the splitter. FlexScan OTDRs also display test results in both AFL’s icon-based LinkMap® view and OTDR trace view, allowing users to quickly and easily locate faults and identify necessary corrective action.<br />
        <br />
        These products along with <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment ">Fujikura fusion splicers</a>, <a href=" /Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant ">fiber management solutions</a> and <a href=" /Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable ">fiber optic cable</a> will be showcased.
