        Spartanburg, SC – Three schools in the upstate of South Carolina received small pine trees from <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL’s</a> <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a> in celebration of Arbor Day. All students, teachers and staff personnel at Beech Springs and Berry Shoals Intermediate schools in Duncan and Townville Elementary in Townville, SC received one tree, for a total of 1,600 trees, to take home and plant or share with a friend or family member.<br />
        <br />
        The effort is part of AFL’s new <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/Thrive.aspx">Thrive!</a> program which promotes conservation efforts such as tree plantings, litter clean-up, recycling and more.<br />
         <br />
        “One of AFL’s core values is environmental stewardship,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “As we donate and plant trees, support and participate in clean-up efforts, or recycle plastics and paper, we feel confident that we are creating an environment that today’s youth will be able to enjoy.”<br />
         <br />
        This is the fifth year in a row that Beech Spring and Berry Shoals Intermediate students received trees to plant, and the first year that Townville Elementary students were presented with trees. Over the past 10 years, AFL has planted more than 20,000 trees, reduced global electricity use by 14 percent, cut natural gas consumption by 42 percent and lowered water use by 11 percent.   <br />
         <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program </a>that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more.
