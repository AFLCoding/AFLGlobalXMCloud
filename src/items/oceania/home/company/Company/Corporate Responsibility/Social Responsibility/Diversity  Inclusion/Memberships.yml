        <p>
        As more associates are being diagnosed as disabled with mental health illness, it is often the most difficult group to support and help return to full, productive work. Mindful Employer is aimed at increasing awareness of mental health at work and providing on-going support for employers in recruitment and retention of staff. They bring together representatives of local employers of all sizes and sectors to discuss issues relating to improving staff well-being and exploring strategies and cultures which help businesses reach their full potential. This is achieved by providing a free forum for sharing experience and best practice. The network meets regularly and occasionally invites top speakers to inspire and challenge attendees.<br />
