        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=700FA7F356564DF8AA34C82971BFE193&_z=z">Wrapping Tube Cable</a> with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=740F36E4074A417CBAB68839104B5517&_z=z">SpiderWeb Ribbon®</a> (SWR) was recognized with a Silver Level Award during the annual <a href="http://www.cablinginstall.com/index.html">Cabling Installation & Maintenance (CI&M)</a> Innovators Awards program, which recognizes innovative products and systems as well as their uses and applications. AFL, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic systems, received the award by demonstrating “a very good innovation that resulted in not just incremental improvement, but in marked improvement over previous methods employed, approaches taken or products/systems used.”<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/CIM_Awards_Silver_SWR_2.aspx" target="_blank"></a>Network and data center operators are continually challenged to meet the growing demand for bandwidth delivery to both consumers and businesses, commented Doug Baker, product line manager for AFL’s cable division. “The many innovations found in our Wrapping Tube Cable enable the deployment of the maximum optical fiber densities commercially available today. Space is at a premium in today’s environment and our solution addresses this in a unique way.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC), with SpiderWeb Ribbon® (SWR), is an ultra-high density outside plant cable designed specifically for fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) or access markets. With an ultra-high density and a ribbon technology called SpiderWeb Ribbon, WTC provides the smallest cable diameter and lowest weight, high-fiber count ribbon cable in the industry. The cable is available with 144 fibers to 1,728 fibers in the armored option and up to 3,456 fibers in the non-armored configuration.<br />
         <br />
        The judging panel consisted of cabling and communications system specifiers, designers, integrators and managers with vast professional experience. The Innovators Awards are judged based on the following criteria: Innovation, Value to the User, Sustainability, Meeting a Defined Need, Collaboration and Impact.<br />
         <br />
        Earlier this year, AFL was the recipient of the 2017 Lightwave Innovation Reviews with a score of four out of five possible points, for the same product. The Innovation Reviews are judged based on originality, innovation, positive impact on the customer, how well it addresses a new or existing requirement, novelty of approach and cost-effectiveness.<br />
