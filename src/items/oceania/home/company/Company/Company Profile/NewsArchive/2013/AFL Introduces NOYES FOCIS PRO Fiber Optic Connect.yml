        Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> introduces the family of <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-PRO-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-System.aspx">NOYES FOCIS PRO</a> automatic fiber inspection solutions that provide network personnel with an automated solution for analysis and documentation of fiber connector cleanliness and integrity, thus completely eliminating the subjective aspect of fiber inspection. Designed for field inspection tasks, FOCIS PRO is a powerful, easy-to-use alternative to existing inspection solutions. Because the optical resolution and detection specification exceed current international standards, and software-based applications are upgradeable, FOCIS PRO solutions are future-proof.<br />
        <br />
        “As network vendors pursue higher data rates associated with the substantial growth in data traffic, the demand for exceptional performance of network systems is becoming more and more crucial,” explained Bill Thompson, marketing director for AFL’s test equipment division. “Simply stated, it is imperative that fibers are clean and free from defects. AFL’s FOCIS PRO system delivers a solution that supports these demanding requirements.”<br />
        <br />
        The FOCIS PRO System consists of the DFD1 Touchscreen Tablet, the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/DFS1-Digital-FiberScope.aspx">DFS1 Digital FiberScope</a> and the new SimpleView™ PRO software. Capable of centering a fiber image, identifying critical core, cladding, adhesive and contact zones while detecting and tallying the types of defects found, this software analyzes a typical fiber in under five seconds. Its Zoom/Pan feature combined with a large, clear display enables users to identify the smallest particles, scratches and imperfections.<br />
        <br />
        Unique to FOCIS and FOCIS PRO products is the patent-pending paired image feature which allows users to make immediate fiber cleanliness comparisons. With the FOCIS PRO, users can capture and save up to 1,000 fiber images, review images on-site and share images via USB memory sticks or SD flash cards. All <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-System.aspx">FOCIS</a> units can be upgraded to the functionality of FOCIS PRO.<br />
        <br />
        FOCIS PRO is the most advanced NOYES fiber inspection product on the market, and only FOCIS PRO combines automatic analysis, inspection and reporting features with superior handheld ergonomics.<br />
