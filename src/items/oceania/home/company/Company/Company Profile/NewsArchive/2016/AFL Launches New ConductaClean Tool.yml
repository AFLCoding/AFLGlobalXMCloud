        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a>, a leading global fiber optic cable and accessories manufacturer, is introducing <a href="/Products/Conductor-Accessories/ConductaClean/Conducta-Clean">ConductaClean</a> for the Distribution market at the <a href="http://www.ieeet-d.org/">IEEE PES Expo</a>, Booth #2501. Originally released in 2009 in a joint EPRI development, the tool was manufactured for transmission only. With the release of a new distribution version, all sizes of transmission and distribution conductor can be quickly and thoroughly cleaned. Additionally, ConductaClean is now available in a new plastic design reducing the overall weight and increasing portability, allowing linemen to operate wherever the splice is most efficiently made.<br />
        <br />
        “As power systems age, the risk of failures due to the deterioration of compression connectors increase,” commented Gary Harter, commercial manager for AFL’s accessories division. “ConductaClean allows line crews to thoroughly clean the conductor without laborious wire brushing. It’s more efficient and in the long run, saves money.”<br />
        <br />
        Manufactured by <a href="http://www.edmlink.com/">EDM International, Inc.</a>, ConductaClean cleans the ends of overhead conductors in virtually all sizes of both transmission and distribution versions prior to installing compression accessories. This system agitates a specialized solution to remove oxidation and grime from conductor strands, cleaning to the inner core in six minutes or less.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="/Products/Conductor-Accessories">AFL’s accessories</a> provide superior performance and reliability for electric power utilities and rail companies.
