        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">AFL</a>, an international leader in fiber optics, conducted a worldwide giving campaign called “Imagine That!” The goal of the campaign was to support communities financially in areas where AFL has locations. Campaigns were launched in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, United States, Mexico and New Zealand and resulted in $290,000 given back to support communities worldwide. <br />
        <br />
        The theme for the companywide campaign was “Be Someone’s Hero” and featured various heroes and heroines including Superman, Batman, Batgirl, Wonder Woman and others. In the United States, AFL supported local United Way organizations while AFL companies outside of the U.S. chose two or three organizations associates would consider supporting. AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> supplemented the campaign by matching associate donations dollar-for-dollar up to $100 each.  <br />
        <br />
        “More and more we see that our associates want to be engaged with their community, to serve and support it somehow,” explained Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Our Community Outreach Program is diverse and offers many opportunities to give back with our time, in service to others and financially. It has become a strong part of our culture.”<br />
        <br />
        Through videos, meetings, vendor displays and more, associates around the world were able to learn about their community, the organizations that are instrumental in providing support to children and families, and how they can impact the lives of others.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more.
