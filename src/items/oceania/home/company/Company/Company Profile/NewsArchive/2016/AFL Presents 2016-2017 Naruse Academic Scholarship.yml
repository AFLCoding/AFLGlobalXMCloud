        Alberta, Canada and Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /">AFL</a> awarded the 2016-2017 <a href=" /Company/Community/Community-Initiatives ">Naruse Academic Scholarship</a> to two individuals this year. Jon Latimer, son of Brian Latimer, services field technician for AFL in Canada, and Katherine Featherstone, daughter of Richard Featherstone, director of manufacturing growth and capital projects for AFL, have both shown exemplary academic success and <a href=" /Company/Community ">community</a> involvement.<br />
        <br />
        Jon Latimer is graduating from Medicine Hat High School in Canada where he was a dedicated member of the school band and performed in several concerts each year. Jon is an avid volunteer at the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, City of Medicine Hat Litter Blitz and Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup. Since early childhood, Jon has aspired to become a teacher and is following his aspirations by pursuing a degree in Humanities at Medicine Hat College with plans to continue his education at a post-secondary institution for education.<br />
        <br />
        Jason Henderson, AFL’s executive director of premise services, and Jordan Young, senior vice president of premise services, presented the award to Jon.<br />
        <br />
        “Jon is thoughtful, engaging and articulate,” commented Henderson. “I am confident that his determination and work ethic will serve him well throughout the rest of his academic career.”<br />
        <br />
        The second recipient is Katherine Featherstone who graduated with distinction from J.L. Mann High School in South Carolina. Having served as co-captain of the varsity tennis team, senior class treasurer and as President of Service for J.L. Mann’s National Honor Society, Katherine was also active with Mann Nation (J.L. Mann’s Spirit Club), Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Forensics Club. Katherine will be pursuing a degree in sociology at Clemson University this fall.<br />
        <br />
        Each year, AFL awards a four-year scholarship to the son or daughter of a North American-based AFL associate entering a college or university. The scholarship was named in memory of Toshihide Naruse, Managing Director of Fujikura, AFL’s parent company. Mr. Naruse’s contributions to AFL were significant, and because of his personal interest in higher education, AFL continues to honor his memory.<br />
