        Tukwila, WA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://lightbrigade.com/Home ">Light Brigade</a>, <a href=" /">AFL</a>’s education and training division, presented <a href="https://www.uwkc.org/">United Way of King County</a> with a check for $5,000, exceeding last year’s donation by 20 percent. The donation was made possible by Light Brigade associates, as well as AFL’s <a href=" /Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a>, which supplemented donations.<br />
        <br />
        This year’s campaign theme stemmed from the Star Wars saga, using the tagline, “Make a Difference, You Can.” Light Brigade made a huge difference by setting a company record with a 36 percent increase in the number of donors and a 10 percent increase in employee donations over 2015.<br />
        <br />
        “Nearly 75 percent of our associates donated to support our community this year,” commented Terrin DesChane, United Way campaign coordinator for Light Brigade. “We are grateful not only for our associates who gave so generously, but also for how United Way supports men, women, children, and families to enable a thriving community.”<br />
        <br />
        The annual United Way Campaign kicked off with a company-wide luncheon that provided an opportunity for each Light Brigade associate to learn more about United Way’s impact. Two agency representatives attended and spoke with associates about their organization and how United Way impacts them.<br />
        <br />
        This is the fourth year that Light Brigade has supported United Way in its community. For more information about Light Brigade, visit <a href="http://www.lightbrigade.com/">www.lightbrigade.com</a>.<br />
