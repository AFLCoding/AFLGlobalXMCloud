        Swindon, UK – <a href=" /">AFL</a> presented <a href="http://mediationplus.co.uk/">mediation<em>plus</em></a> a £1,092 grant to help provide crucial counselling services for children whose parents are separating or separated, in the Swindon area. mediation<em>plus</em> provides a free counselling service for children between the ages of five and 18 who have been significantly affected by the divorce or separation of their parents.<br />
        <br />
        “Many of the children accessing the service will have been profoundly affected by their parent’s separation,” stated Jeni Burchell, CEO of mediation<em>plus</em>. “The effects of divorce and separation on children and young people are well documented. There is the emotional distress to cope with which if not addressed can have far reaching negative effects. The change of family circumstances and loss of familiar routines is also difficult for children to comprehend and adjust to. Often children will have to leave their homes, school and friends if they have to relocate to another area. All of these issues can affect the child’s emotional, psychological and social well-being.”<br />
        <br />
        Every year approximately, £30,000 has to be raised to operate the counselling service. Last year 44 children and young people were counselled by mediation<em>plus</em>. As a result of attending the project children should be better able to understand, express and manage the feelings they have arising from the separation of their parents.<br />
        <br />
        “We are delighted to be able to help mediation<em>plus</em>,” said Margaret Harman, AFL HR & EHS manager in Swindon. “Our grant donation will provide 14 hours of counselling for children who are struggling with the emotional experience of family separation, who otherwise may not have the opportunity to receive support.”<br />
