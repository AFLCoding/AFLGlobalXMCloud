        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> has updated its line of <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Enterprise/Inside-Plant-Cable/Indoor_Outdoor_Plenum_Tight_Buffered_Cable.aspx">Indoor/Outdoor Plenum Distribution Cables</a>. Ideal for interbuilding campus network cabling, the NFPA 70 Article 770-compliant plenum cable supports installations where a transition from a traditional loose tube outside plant cable is problematic and cost prohibitive.<br />
         <br />
        Based on 900 µm tight buffered designs, AFL’s Indoor/Outdoor Plenum Cable family can be efficiently terminated in the field when using either mechanical or splice-on connectors. The outer jacket is moisture, fungus and UV-resistant, making AFL’s Indoor/Outdoor Plenum Distribution Cable reliable for both outdoor and underground buried-duct applications.<br />
         <br />
        “With a strong focus on engineering and design, AFL continually works on improving our solutions by listening to our customer base. The new design of the indoor/outdoor ONFP- and plenum-rated cable was a direct result of customer feedback in order to meet the need for implementing campus network installations,” explained Doug Baker, commercial manager for enterprise cable at AFL. “Our updated family of Indoor/Outdoor plenum-rated cables provides a sound building block for those networks.”<br />
         <br />
        The new Indoor/Outdoor Plenum Distribution Cable is suitable for spaces requiring plenum, riser, general purpose and outside plant UL flame ratings. Available in single-mode and multimode, including Laser-Optimized 50 µm OM4, cables within the family are also available with options up to 24 fibers.<br />
        <br />
