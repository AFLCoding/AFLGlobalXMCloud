        Tukwila, WA and Spartanburg, SC –The <a href="https://www.lightbrigade.com/Home ">Light Brigade</a>, the world leader in fiber optic training, has launched its new brand providing a fresh, more relevant image for the 25-year-old company.<br />
        <br />
        At the centerpiece of the new brand is a new logo, which features an updated symbol providing several ties to the Light Brigade’s history as well as its future. The symbol first represents light being refracted through media of two different densities, showing the light moving from the dark blue to the lighter blue. The core of the Light Brigade’s training courses is teaching students about fiber optics and its many uses across multiple industries and applications. Looking at the symbol differently, it appears to be a traditional textbook, a nod to the Light Brigade’s heritage. Last, the viewer may see a chevron insignia, a link to the former imagery and the Light Brigade name.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to the logo, the Light Brigade reviewed and updated all elements of the Light Brigade brand to better reflect the company’s progression. While most elements were changed, certain elements of the former brand, for example the company name and basic color scheme, were preserved.<br />
        <br />
        “The Light Brigade’s logo and brand had not been refreshed since the company was founded in 1987. Over the years, the Light Brigade has grown from offering just a few fiber optic classes in one location in Tukwila to a diverse portfolio with hundreds of classes offered each year at locations around the world,” said Dario DePaolis, general manager for the Light Brigade. “We also offer a complete DVD library, a number of related fiber optic tools and products, and certifications from technical associations around the world. We have trained over 45,000 students, and we wanted our new brand to reflect the progress the Light Brigade has made in a relatively short period of time.”<br />
