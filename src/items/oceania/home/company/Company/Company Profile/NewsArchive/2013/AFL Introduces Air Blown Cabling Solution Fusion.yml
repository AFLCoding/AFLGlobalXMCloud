        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a> is introducing a host of new products at the upcoming <a href="http://www.bicsi.org/winter/2013/attendee.aspx">2013 BICSI Winter Conference and Exhibition</a>, Jan. 20-23 at the Tampa Convention Center in Florida.<br />
         <br />
        AFL’s newest product is <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Solutions/Air-Blown-Fiber.aspx">eABF™ Enterprise Air-Jetted Fiber Cabling Solution</a>. Developed by AFL and Dura-Line, eABF provides the highest fiber density solution in the market. The eABF cable features exceptional air-jetting qualities yet is rugged enough to comply with Telcordia’s GR-409 and NEC riser and plenum flame ratings. The eABF pathway system is comprised of Enterprise FuturePath products and includes Indoor/Outdoor HDPE, riser, plenum and LSZH product lines. Combined, the eABF solution delivers an upgradeable physical pathway with the highest fiber density.<br />
         <br />
        AFL is also launching the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers-Single-Fiber/Fujikura-12S-Fusion-Splicer.aspx">Fujikura 12S fusion splicer</a>, the world’s smallest, lightest and most portable fusion splicer. Refinements in the arc calibration and optical systems have extended the electrode life to 3,000 splices. And splicing and tube heating are 20 percent quicker than previous models. Backed by the best service team in the industry, the new 12S fusion splicer is the ideal splicer to use when portability, versatility, and reliability are a priority.<br />
         <br />
        AFL will be demonstrating the Next Generation FuseConnect, a four-component connector that simplifies the installation process. With a broad environmental tolerance, the new FuseConnect does not require the use of an external heater oven. It continues to be available in 900 µm, 2 mm and 3 mm with compatibility in all fiber types. The Poli-MOD 2 will also be exhibited at BICSI. With tool-less cable entry, the new Poli-MOD highly simplifies installation for enhanced “behind-the-wall” fiber management.<br />
         <br />
        As the technology leader in fiber optic cabling, accessories and components, AFL delivers modularity, flexibility in design, density and scalability from optical fiber and cable to the hardware and connectivity in your data center.
