        <p>Spartanburg, S.C. – Twice in the past two years, daredevil Nik Wallenda has completed high-wire walks on two-inch-thick metal cables that were stabilized with <a href="/">AFL</a>’s <a href="/Products/Conductor-Accessories/HiTemp-Accessories/AFL-HiTemp-Transmission-Conductor-Vibration-Damper ">Stockbridge Dampers</a>. For his most recent stunt at the Grand Canyon, 20 dampers were attached to Wallenda’s cable as he tiptoed from one side of the Little Colorado River Gorge to the other.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Stockbridge Dampers are used to eliminate cable vibrations, which can cause damage to conductors, hardware and towers, and are the most efficient way to extend the life of a transmission line. For Wallenda, the dampers offered a steady cable during his quarter mile trek across the gorge. They also kept his cable from vibrating when he crossed over Niagara Falls in 2012.<br />
        <br />
        Offering the widest range of vibration coverage in the industry, AFL’s dampers have two natural frequency modes, commonly known as “flying” and “wiggling.” AFL uses a specifically designed 19-strand messenger wire allowing the damper to dissipate vibration, or “wake up,” at lower energy levels, thereby reducing the damaging force of nature. In addition, AFL provides a Vibrec™ Damper Recommendation Program to assist in damper requirements for transmission and distribution lines.</p>
