        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, recognized several associates for receiving patent awards for developing new products and technologies within the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&_z=z">optical connectivity</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=55E85DE502FD4DF7A029245253934A91&_z=z">fusion splicing</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=67697A36EE374C21A1F009672463F0E6&_z=z">test and inspection</a> divisions.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Test & Inspection team received two patents. The first patent was for “Multiple Wavelength Optical Assemblies for Inline Measurement of Optical Power and Fiber Optic Networks.” The technology is used in Passive Optical Network power meters employed to measure optical power in FTTx and Optical LAN systems. The assemblies reduce the insertion loss seen in traditional PON meter optical assemblies and can be configured to measure power in NG-PON2 and XG-PON systems. The second patent was for “Systematic Inspection of MTP Images using Live, Still, or Stored Images.” This invention is used to perform before and after comparisons of MTP/MPO optical connector ferrules. The stored video images can be from pre-cleaning inspection or from inspections performed after construction/installation.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s cable division received five patents including “Applying Aluminum Coating Layer to a Core of Copper Wire,” an invention that allows the manufacture of bimetallic aluminum over copper conductive elements that both increase conductivity and reduce corrosion in cables. “Ultra-high fiber density Micro-Duct Cable with Extreme Operating Performance” was patented and allows AFL’s OSP MicroCore cables to maintain high density with improved tension and temperature ranges similar to much larger cables. Additionally, a patent was received for “downhole cables with both fiber and copper elements,” an invention that further enhances AFL’s downhole oil & gas product line, and for “distributed pressure temp sensor cable (sensing cable) which allows AFL to design and build cables that can provide distributed temperature and pressure sensing fibers under extreme conditions in a single cable. Last, AFL received a patent for “Tamper Sensitive Fiber Optic Cable,” a fiber optic cable that utilizes a unique construction and optical elements to allow real-time cable monitoring.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Optical Connectivity and Apparatus division received two patents. The first is for an efficient method of stacking fiber optic reels on a modified pallet. The second is for a high fiber capacity full ocean strength splice housing available in inline and loopback configurations.<br />
