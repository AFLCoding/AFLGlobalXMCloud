        Swindon, United Kingdom and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> partnered with the <a href="http://www.wbct.org.uk/">Wilts and Berks Canal Trust</a>, planting more than 150 native British trees and hedgerow stock on a restored section of the canal in the Swindon area. The project was part of AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/Take-Root.aspx">Take Root</a> program, which aims to plant 12,000 trees by 2015.<br />
        <br />
        The AFL volunteer team group joined Canal Trust’s volunteers to plant the trees, contributing 26 hours of time to enhance the surrounding area alongside the canal at Mouldon Hill, Swindon. The planting of hedgerow is an important element in the restoration of the canal as it creates habitat for wildlife as well as an important boundary and natural safety barrier to the farmlands or communities that the canal passes through.<br />
        <br />
        "The Canal Trust selects the types of tree plants very carefully, making sure that they not only provide the right environment for habitat, but also that they are low growing species that will not grow too tall and overhang the towpath,” said Ray Aldridge, Project Director Central, Wilts and Berks Canal Trust. “We also need to make sure the root systems will not grow into the canal bed in years to come. The efforts of today’s restoration are carefully planned for the continued use of the canal well into the future.”<br />
        <br />
        Throughout the year, AFL hosts Take Root events on its worldwide campuses and with organisations in communities where AFL has facilities. AFL’s extensive <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a> provides many opportunities to connect with its local communities and encourages associates to volunteer for activities throughout the year.
