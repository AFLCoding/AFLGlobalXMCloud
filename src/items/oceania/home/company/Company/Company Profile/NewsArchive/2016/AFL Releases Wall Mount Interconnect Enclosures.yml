        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a>, a leading global fiber optics manufacturer and service provider, introduces two wall-mount interconnect enclosures featuring LGX mounting positions. The <a href="/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Indoor-Wall-Mounted-Panels/WME-01-Wall-Mount-Interconnect-Enclosure">WME-01</a> and <a href="/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Indoor-Wall-Mounted-Panels/WME-12-Wall-Mount-Interconnect-Enclosure">WME-12 enclosures</a> provide a convenient convergence point for interconnecting and/or splicing in wall mount applications.<br />
         <br />
        Developed with one LGX-compatible adapter plate or optical module, the <a href="/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Indoor-Wall-Mounted-Panels/WME-01-Wall-Mount-Interconnect-Enclosure">WME-01 enclosure</a> features a well-engineered solution for fiber and cable management on both the top and bottom openings of the enclosure. The WME-01 includes a front access door which is lockable with a common pad-lock or tube-style keyed lock. With one LGX mounting position, the WME-01 enclosure has a 12 to 24 fiber patch and splice density.<br />
         <br />
        Provisioned for up to 12 LGX-compatible optical modules, the <a href="/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Indoor-Wall-Mounted-Panels/WME-12-Wall-Mount-Interconnect-Enclosure">WME-12 enclosure</a> features a well-engineered solution for fiber and cable management on both the ingress and egress openings of the enclosure. The WME12 features discrete access doors with separate locking options for flexibility and security. With 12 LGX mounting positions, the WME-12 has up to 288 fiber density.<br />
         <br />
        “The new wall-mount enclosures are ideal for new and existing interconnect, cross-connect and co-location environments,” explained Tom Jeffers, associate product manager for AFL’s ISP product line. “These enclosures expand AFL’s fiber management product line, providing patch and splice solutions for up to 288 fibers in both rack and wall-mount applications.”<br />
        <br />
        The enclosure’s steel construction ensures the highest level of protection for sensitive components and the integrated roll-formed hinges eliminate possible fiber pinch points while deploying or servicing components within. The modular design is fully compatible with <a href="/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Modules-and-Panel-Accessories/Optical-Modules/Poli-MOD-Patch-and-Splice-Module">Poli-MOD® Patch and Splice Modules</a> and <a href="/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Rack-Mount-Patch-Panels/Xpress-Fiber-Management-(XFM)-Patch-Panels/Xpress-Fiber-Management-(XFM)-Optical-Cassettes">XFM® optical cassettes</a>. The enclosures are ideal for co-location sites, customer premise, hub/OTN sites, telecommunication closets and campus/enterprise environments.<br />
