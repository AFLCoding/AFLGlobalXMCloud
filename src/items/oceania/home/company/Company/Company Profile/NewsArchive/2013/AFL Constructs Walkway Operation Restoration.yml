        Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /">AFL</a> associates spent almost two days building a concrete walkway for Operation Restoration’s <a href="http://www.operationrestorationcdc.org/Veterans_Services.html">Welcome Home</a> house near downtown Spartanburg. <a href="http://www.operationrestorationcdc.org/Home.html">Operation Restoration</a> is a nonprofit organization that helps low-income families break free from financial hardships and develop self-sustaining, community-building lifestyles.<br />
        <br />
        In support of these veterans, AFL volunteers bought supplies to build a path to the recently constructed deck in the backyard and planted 14 azalea shrubs. The endeavor is part of the company’s <a href=" /Company/Community/ACT-Project ">ACT (AFL Community Team) project</a> which provides volunteer service to nonprofit organizations in the community.<br />
        <br />
        “Several of the veterans living in this home are confined to wheelchairs and can only enter the house from the front or if the backyard is dry enough,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “We are eager to help the community when and where we can, so we immediately jumped on the opportunity to help Operation Restoration’s Welcome Home program and provide access to the backyard and a nice retreat for veterans to enjoy.”<br />
        <br />
        Welcome Home offers shelter and case management for our nation’s veterans for a length of 24 months. During this time, veterans set life goals, seek and secure employment and prepare to rejoin society.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s <a href=" /Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a> awards several grants each year in addition to planning volunteer projects for various nonprofits. The program also includes sponsorships, Take Root (a program to provide trees to communities), disaster relief, an annual United Way campaign and a yearly Week of Service.<br />
        <br />
