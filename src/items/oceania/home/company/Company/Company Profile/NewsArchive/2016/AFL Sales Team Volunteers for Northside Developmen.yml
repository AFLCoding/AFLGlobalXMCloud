        <a href=" /">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable accessories, volunteered time and talent with the <a href="http://www.spartanburgndg.com/">Northside Development Group</a> (NDG) in Spartanburg, SC. During AFL’s national sales meeting, 35 sales managers from the United States and Canada joined efforts to repair three homes in the Northside community.<br />
        <br />
        “Collectively, we were able to support three families that needed help with different projects. The impact we had was immediate but there’s so much more to be done,” commented Steve Ferguson, vice president of sales and marketing for AFL. “The Northside initiative will have an immeasurable impact in the community. We plan to continue supporting NDG and its efforts.”<br />
        <br />
        Known as an <a href=" /Company/Community/ACT-Project ">ACT</a> (AFL Community Team) project, associates come together to provide a service to the community and then supplement the project with funding. Tasks with the Northside community included rebuilding steps, building a wheelchair ramp, yard maintenance and painting several rooms.  <br />
        <br />
        “This was a great partnership opportunity between NDG and AFL to support homeowners in the Northside to receive much needed repairs on their homes,” said Tammy Hoy, CNI program manager for NDG. “This was part of the Northside Initiatives' effort to support existing residents as part of the neighborhood redevelopment effort.”<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="http://www.spartanburgndg.com/">Northside Development Group</a> is a nonprofit organization that manages the redevelopment of the City of Spartanburg’s Northside community, expanding the economic, educational, recreational health and social opportunities for its residents.<br />
        <br />
        AFL has a robust <a href=" /Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a> that includes grants, scholarships, associate engagement projects, conservation initiatives and more.
