        Spartanburg, SC — AFL presented the 2010 - 2011 Naruse Scholarship Award last week to Brian Foley, son of Sean Foley, Market Development Manager for AFL's R&D Center and an AFL associate of 12 years. Brian is a graduating senior of JL Mann High School where he is ranked in the top 10 of his class. During his high school career, he was awarded "AP Scholar with Distinction", National Merit Scholar Letter of Commendation, and 1st place in a local Law Day Essay contest. He received recognition from several regional colleges for his academic achievements including the Washington and Lee Book Award, Furman Scholar, Wofford Scholar and Presbyterian College Fellow.<br />
        <br />
        Brian is actively involved in high school through his participation in cross country, speech and debate and as captain of the academic team. Outside of school, he serves his church as an usher and a Peer Minister for his youth group. He is a Boy Scout and earned the rank of Eagle at age 16. His Eagle Scout project involved building a dock and beautifying the area at Paris Mountain’s Lake Buckhorn. The project included 70 hours of planning and personal effort, as well as managing over 190 volunteer man-hours. As part of the Student Conservation Association, he spent the last two summers living in wilderness areas for three to four weeks each building trails in Vermont and Alaska.<br />
        <br />
        Brian received appointments to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD and the United States Military Academy in West Point, NY and was accepted into Clemson, Georgia Tech, Duke and University of Penn. He chose to attend MIT this fall, where he plans to major in mechanical engineering.<br />
        <br />
        The Naruse Scholarship Fund is administered by the Center for Scholarship Administration located in Greenville, South Carolina. Rising seniors of AFL associates are eligible for up to $2,000 per year, with a cap of $8,000 per student per year over a four-year period.
