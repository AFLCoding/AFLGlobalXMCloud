        Spartanburg, SC - AFL announces that the Middle Tyger Community Center (MTCC) received a $12,300 Fujikura FoundationGrant to support the Family Literacy Program, addressing the low literacy and educational needs of the parent and the developmental needs of the child. The overall goal of the Family Literacy Program is to promote family sufficiency through integrating the four components of the program which include: Adult Education; Developmentally Appropriate Child Care Services; Parenting Classes; and Interactive Literacy Activities.<br />
        <br />
        Wanda Fowler, Executive Director of Middle Tyger Community Center, expressed her appreciation on behalf of the Board, Staff, and the families MTCC serves: "The Fujikura Foundation Grant comes at a very crucial time for MTCC. Last June our Even Start Grant through the SC State Department of Education which funded two of our four childcare classrooms came to a close. We greatly appreciate the support of AFL as we continue offering childcare to a most vulnerable population. The leaders and staff of AFL have demonstrated their commitment to the community through this grant and the many other projects in the community they support."<br />
        <br />
        Goals of the Family Literacy Program include: improved educational levels for parents, developed work skills leading to employment; child care allowing for development at a normal rate in the areas of social, emotional, motor and cognitive development; improved parenting skills; and increased time spent by parents reading to and interacting with children. MTCC will be providing GED classes, monthly case management meetings, child care rooms for adolescent mothers, and. parenting classes to achieve these goals.<br />
        <br />
        "On behalf of AFL and the Fujikura Foundation, we are pleased to continue supporting the Middle Tyger Community Center’s mission to reach out to the community and build healthy families," said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. "MTCC is a tremendous asset to our community. We applaud their efforts to address literacy, essentially providing an opportunity for citizens to gain valuable skills and ultimately break the cycle of poverty."<br />
