        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, partnered with the <a href="http://greenvillerec.com/">Greenville County Recreation District</a> (GCRD) to plant over 30 trees along the <a href="http://greenvillerec.com/swamprabbit">Swamp Rabbit Trail</a> in Greenville County. This marks the seventh year in a row that AFL has partnered with GCRD to plant trees in celebration of Arbor Day in South Carolina.  <br />
         <br />
        Part of AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/Take-Root.aspx">Take Root program</a>, 27 AFL volunteers plus friends and family came out to plant trees, spread mulch and pull vines and debris along the Reedy River. Volunteers contributed over 80 hours to enhance the section of the trail near West Washington at mile marker SR316 and Republic Locomotive.<br />
         <br />
        “The Swamp Rabbit Trail is an integral part of Greenville, attracting thousands of walkers, runners and cyclists each year. We hope the beautiful landscape will encourage others in our community to use the trail and live active, healthy lifestyles,” stated Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “We are honored to be a part of something that has made a positive impact in our community.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL has a goal to plant 12,000 trees by 2015 under the Take Root initiative. AFL’s extensive <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a> provides many opportunities to connect with its local communities and encourages associates to volunteer for activities throughout the year.
