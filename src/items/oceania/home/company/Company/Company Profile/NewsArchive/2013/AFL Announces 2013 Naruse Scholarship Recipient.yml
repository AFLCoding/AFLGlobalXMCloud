        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="/">AFL</a> presented the 2013-2014 <a href="/Company/Community/Community-Initiatives ">Naruse Academic Scholarship</a> award to Robert Borowicz, son of Eric Borowicz, operations manager for AFL’s conductor accessories division. Robert’s academic and extracurricular achievements have secured awards, scholarships and a foundation for future success.<br />
        <br />
        Ranked fifth in his class at J.L. Mann High School, Robert is a member of the National Honor Society and recipient of the Furman Scholar Award and PC Fellow Award. He received a perfect score on the ACT math section, scored 4 or higher on all Advanced Placement (AP) exams and will be recognized as an AP Scholar with Distinction.<br />
        <br />
        Similar to Robert’s academic conduct is his athletic ambition. His passion for swimming began at age eight when he joined his first swim team. In high school, he became J.L. Mann’s Men’s Swim Team captain and was selected six times as an all-state swimmer. In the 2013 4A State Swimming Championship, Robert won a silver medal in the boys 200 medley relay and a bronze in the 100 backstroke. He is also a junior national qualifier and a member of USA Swimming’s Scholastic All-America Team, comprised of high school student-athletes who have obtained a GPA of 3.5 or higher.<br />
        <br />
        Robert plans to continue his education at the Georgia Institute of Technology where he will major in computer engineering. As for swimming, he will sign his National Letter of Intent to swim at Georgia Tech this month. Robert plans to take his passion for swimming all the way to the Olympics.<br />
        <br />
        Administered by the Center for Scholarship Administration, AFL’s Naruse Scholarship is awarded to eligible senior high school students of full time U.S.-based AFL employees with a minimum of one year of service. The amount of the scholarship is up to $2,000 per year, with a cap of $8,000 per student per year over a four-year period.
