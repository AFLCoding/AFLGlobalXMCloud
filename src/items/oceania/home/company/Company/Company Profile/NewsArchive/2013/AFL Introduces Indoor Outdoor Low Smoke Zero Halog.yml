        Spartanburg, SC – Ideal for rugged applications and installations requiring high performance, AFL's <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Enterprise/Low-Smoke-Zero-Halogen-Cable/Low-Smoke-Zero-Halogen-Indoor-Outdoor-Breakout-Cab.aspx">Indoor/Outdoor Low Smoke Zero Halogen (LSZH) Breakout Cables</a> feature a durable IEC and UL Standards compliant zero halogen, UV and fungal resistant outer jacket. These cables are available from two to 24 fibers with variable sub-cable dimensions that support specific termination and routing requirements. Sub-cables can be specified at 2.0 mm, 2.4 mm or 2.9 mm diameters and include AFL’s industry-proven 900 µm tight buffer for ease of termination. These solutions are highly customizable and tailored to the needs of the customer. Additional strength members are applied to support wedge-style industrial termination schemes.<br />
         <br />
        “Fiber optic cables utilizing Low Smoke Zero Halogen materials in their construction provide protection against an excessive generation of smoke and potentially toxic gases when exposed to high-heat or fire conditions,” stated Doug Baker, commercial manager for AFL’s enterprise cable systems. “Generally installed in areas where ventilation is of concern, AFL’s lineup of LSZH Fiber Optic Cables is suitable for inclusion in applications spanning from the campus network to heavy industrial installations.”<br />
         <br />
        Cables are UL-1666 Riser and UL-1685 Low-Smoke rated while exceeding the stringent requirements of Telcordia GR-409-CORE issue 2, ICEA-S-104-696, and further compliant to Directive 2002/95/EC (RoHS).<br />
