        <p>Swindon, United Kingdom and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, a leading global fibre optics manufacturer, and <a href="http://www.swindon-cricklade-railway.org/">Swindon and Cricklade Railway</a>, Wiltshire’s only standard gauge railway running heritage steam and diesel trains, partnered to establish a native hedgerow along a restored section of railway line. The project was part of AFL’s <a href="http://link.email.dynect.net/link.php?H=m4XSjXOx%2B2Pgejs7VQif2z1mpaMnooy5A%2FJA79jzd4MJG2Wr7PV45KqOGfNSzZSYugaL5wsa%2B8ys3oZdK%2B7j%2Fnhsz%2F%2BntU2Y%2FiBVBVIO6Bw%3D&G=553&R=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aflglobal.com%2FCMSModules%2FNewsletters%2FCMSPages%2FRedirect.ashx%3Flinkguid%3D43df671b-b644-4f31-a770-e8a50951e000%26subscriberguid%3D58c56ebf-d3fe-4638-93a6-9293768df337%26contactid%3D830203&I=20140318161255.4BD817B30054%40mail6-06-pao&X=">Take Root</a> program which aims to plant or provide 12,000 trees by 2015.<br />
        <br />
        The AFL volunteer team joined Swindon and Cricklade railway volunteers to plant 370 trees and hedgerow bushes, contributing 18 hours of time to enhance the surrounding area alongside the railway line at Oakhurst, Swindon. The planting of hedgerow is an important element in the restoration and maintenance of the railway as it creates habitat for wildlife as well as a boundary and natural safety barrier to the farmlands or communities that the railway line passes through.</p>
        <p>“Safety is the most important consideration when running and maintaining the railway,” said James Howes, signalling manager for Swindon and Cricklade Railway. “Where the remote sections of line pass by local communities, it can be tempting for some people to risk crossing the line as a shortcut or for children playing. When the trees we planted mature, they will help keep people away from the line whilst also enhancing the local wildlife habitat.”<br />
        <br />
        Formed in 1978, the Swindon and Cricklade Railway’s objective was to reconstruct and preserve a section of railway than ran from Andover to Cheltenham. Since then, the railway has expanded and a third station will officially open soon. The Railway is planning additional stations as it progresses toward Cricklade.<br />
        <br />
        Throughout the year, AFL hosts Take Root events on its worldwide campuses and with organisations in communities where AFL has facilities.
