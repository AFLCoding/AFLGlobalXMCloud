        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;"><strong>Spartanburg, SC</strong> - AFL(http://www.aflglobal.com) reached a monumental milestone, manufacturing and shipping its 150,000th kilometer of Optical Ground Wire(http://www.afltele.com/products/fiber_optic_cable/opgw_cable/index.html) (OPGW), making it the first company in the world to achieve this noteworthy distinction. Since 1985 when the company first began manufacturing OPGW at its Duncan, South Carolina facility, AFL has shipped this high-tech cable to more than 65 countries worldwide – in regions as demanding as the Alaskan tundra to the stunning landscapes of Zambia.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">“Optical Ground Wire was the product on which our company was founded nearly 25 years ago,” said Kurt Dallas, Vice President and General Manager of AFL’s Cable Systems. “Since then, AFL’s products and services have grown into all facets of telecommunications. Our ability to succeed and excel in a global market for two-and-a-half decades is a testament to our longevity and commitment to quality. We owe a debt of gratitude to our utility customers throughout North America and the World. We are already looking forward to the next 150,000 kilometers as our company continues to grow and thrive.”</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">KAMO Electric Cooperatives, Inc.(http://www.kamopower.com/) (KAMO Power) is the recipient of the 150,000th cable kilometer. Headquartered in Vinita, Oklahoma, KAMO is a Generation and Transmission (G&T) cooperative serving 17 member distribution cooperatives in northeast Oklahoma and southwest Missouri.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">“Having a robust and reliable communications infrastructure is critical to operating a complex electrical network in the most safe and efficient manner possible,” states Walter Kenyon, Chief Technology Officer for KAMO Electric Cooperative, Inc. “AFL’s commitment to high quality products and services has played a key role in our ability to monitor the electrical network on a second by second basis, as well as provide the framework on which Smart Grid technologies will be deployed today and in the future.”</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">AFL and KAMO are celebrating this event prior to the installation of the cable. Starting at AFL’s facility in South Carolina, the fiber optic cable was specially-wrapped with a design commemorating the 150,000th km and employees gathered around the reel prior to shipping for a special photo op – a memoir for each who was instrumental in shaping AFL, commencing in this event. From there the cable will travel on a flat bed truck to KAMO Power’s headquarters where executives from both companies will participate in celebrating this achievement again.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Optical Ground Wire (OPGW) is a dual-functioning cable that serves as the ground wire for power lines, while providing a path for the transmission of voice, video or data signals by incorporating optical fibers into the design of the cable. OPGW is placed at the highest point on power utility structures, allowing for fast, cost-effective installations with exceptional reliability.</p>
