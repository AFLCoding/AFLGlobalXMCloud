        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a> introduces the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Cleavers/CT05-Series-Fiber-Cleaver.aspx">CT-05 fiber cleaver</a>, a single fiber cleaver that provides high quality cleaving. Ideal for installing <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Connectors-and-Accessories/Field-Installable-Connectors.aspx">field installable connectors</a> and <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Connectors-and-Accessories/Mechanical-Splices.aspx">mechanical splices</a>, this new cleaver is rugged yet compact and lightweight. The 16-position circular blade performs cleaving in one simple, single step operation and provides up to 48,000 cleaves.<br />
        <br />
        “Fujikura is known for high quality products and the new CT-05 fiber cleaver is no different,” stated Greg Pickeral, product manager for AFL’s fusion splicing division. “Given its small size and robustness, the new cleaver is highly suitable for outside plant installations where conditions might be extreme.”<br />
        <br />
        The CT-05 cleaver includes an adapter plate, scrap collector, carry case, hex wrench and instruction manual. For more information on AFL’s products and services, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
