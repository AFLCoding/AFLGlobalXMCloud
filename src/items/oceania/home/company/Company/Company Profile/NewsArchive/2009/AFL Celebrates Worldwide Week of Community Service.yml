        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;"><strong>Spartanburg, SC</strong> - During the week of November 16, AFL(http://www.aflglobal.com) locations around the world celebrated the 2nd annual Worldwide Week of Community Service. Dedicated to the communities in which AFL operates, this Week of Service engages employees in various aspects of giving back to the community(http://www.afltele.com/company/community/) – including time and resources.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">AFL Spartanburg associates kicked off the week by sending two car loads and one truck load of non-perishable food items to District Five Family Ministries in Lyman. The pantry has been extremely low this year and associates’ donations were helpful to families who need this assistance. Traditional Thanksgiving items were also donated; ensuring families have a hearty Thanksgiving meal.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">On Wednesday, 22 volunteers from AFL converged at United Way’s Gifts-In-Kind Center to sort through three semi-trucks filled with damaged and returned items. Volunteers sorted everything from toys to diapers and hair care products to picnic items. These items are donated to the local community for use at non-profit organizations in Spartanburg, Cherokee, Union and surrounding counties. This means that local agencies will never have to spend $15,000 out of their budget for diapers or $3,000 for paper goods, plus so much more!</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">This volunteer project is part of AFL’s SPIRIT grant program(http://www.afltele.com/company/community/spirit_projects.html) which matches the “sweat equity” of AFL employees with a $3,000 grant to the organization chosen for community service. The check was presented to Kathy Dunleavy, President and CEO of United Way of the Piedmont.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">To conclude the week of service, AFL associates also took part in AFL’s Take Root program(http://www.afltele.com/company/community/take_root.html) – an effort to plant 5,000 trees by 2010. Each associate received a weeping cherry tree this year to plant at their home or area of their choosing.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">“AFL associates worldwide look forward to this week each year,” stated Corie Culp, AFL’s community relations manager. “They are eager to provide their time and resources. This week provides a glimpse of where the needs are, providing the opportunity to get involved and helping those less fortunate than ourselves. For many it’s an eye-opening experience. They are impacted by those they serve during this week, and continue giving back throughout the year.”</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Several other AFL locations planned events including AFL in Belmont, New Hampshire where associates organized a coat and mitten drive, donating items to the local Salvation Army. Then, they culminated the week with “Soup Day.” Associates brought in various soups, casseroles and desserts; paid $5/person for lunch, and bought turkeys for a local shelter with the donations.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">AFL in Monterrey, Mexico kicked off the week with a SPIRIT project. Fourteen volunteers painted, cleaned and water-proofed two libraries in Apodaca, and thereafter, presented at $3,000 SPIRIT grant check. In Germany, AFL associates took up a collection of food items to donate to Volksverein, a social organization that supports the disabled in the city.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">AFL's Network Services also participated in this week. In Ashland, Virginia, 11 volunteers worked approximately 80 hours in various shifts at a local Community Kitchen. Time was spent preparing, delivering and serving hot meals for the Virginia Food Bank. In addition, associates in the Harpursville, New York office washed and waxed a number of fire trucks and other emergency vehicles that respond in the community’s time of need. Associates in the Monroe, North Carolina office took up a collection of food, paper goods, baby items and clothing to donate to Turning Point, a local organization that assists domestic violence victims.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Associates around the world had the opportunity to give back to our communities in so many different ways and addressing so many different needs. AFL will celebrate the 3rd Annual Worldwide Week of Community service in November 2010.</p>
