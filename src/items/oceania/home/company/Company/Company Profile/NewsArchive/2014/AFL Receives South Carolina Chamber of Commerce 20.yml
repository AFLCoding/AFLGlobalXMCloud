        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> was presented with a Commendation of Excellence for Safety by the <a href="http://www.scchamber.net/">South Carolina Chamber of Commerce</a>. Each year, the South Carolina Chamber recognizes businesses at more than 500 company locations across the state for making workplace safety a priority. The Annual Safety Awards recognize companies and their associates who have had a commendable Lost Workday Case Rate during the previous calendar year.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL’s manufacturing facilities in South Carolina house a large sector of the company’s operations,” said Doug Hoffman, environmental, health and safety (EHS) director for AFL. “We strive to provide our customers with the best products and services on the market, and step one is to ensure the safety of our associates while maintaining productivity at our plants.”<br />
        <br />
        Recipients of the state Chamber’s safety award must have a recordable and lost workday injury rate that is below the state’s average. Throughout 2013, Ridgeview manufacturing associates have worked 2,836,536 hours and Hidden Lake manufacturing associates have worked 3,460,296 without a lost workday incident.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Environment-Health-and-Safety.aspx">EHS program</a> is committed to providing a safe work environment for all its associates. Policies and procedures are audited annually to expose areas that need improvement, and every associate must complete annual EHS training courses.<br />
