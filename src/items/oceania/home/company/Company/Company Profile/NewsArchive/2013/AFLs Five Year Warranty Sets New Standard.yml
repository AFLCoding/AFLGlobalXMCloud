        Spartanburg, SC and Lowell, MA  – <a href=" /">AFL</a> increased the warranty period on <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection ">NOYES®</a> <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Optical-Power-Meters ">Optical Power Meters (OPM)</a>, <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Optical-Light-Sources ">Optical Light Sources (OLS)</a> and <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Optical-Fiber-Identifiers ">Fiber Identifiers (OFI)</a> to five years, at least two years greater than industry standards on these products. In addition, because of the products’ overall durability, AFL is extending the recommended calibration interval from one year to three years.<br />

        “We are confident that our test sets are the most reliable on the market today,” explains Seán Adam, general manager for AFL’s NOYES Test and Inspection Division. “By increasing the calibration interval and warranty period, we are giving our customers additional assurance that they are buying a high quality product and that their investment is well-protected.”<br />
         <br />
        NOYES Test and Inspection products are in use daily around the world. From Optical Time Domain Reflectometers (<a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators ">OTDRs</a>) and <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Loss-Test-sets ">loss test kits</a> to <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection ">inspection</a> and <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Cleaning ">cleaning</a> products, NOYES products are engineered to endure outside plant environments, and feature intuitive user interfaces that provide quick results without complicated training requirements.<br />
         <br />
