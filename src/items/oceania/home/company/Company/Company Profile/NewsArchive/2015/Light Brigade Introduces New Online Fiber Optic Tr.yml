        Tukwila, WA and Spartanburg, SC – September 24, 2015 – <a href="https://www.lightbrigade.com/Home.aspx">The Light Brigade</a>, <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>’s training and education division, is introducing its new <a href="https://www.lightbrigade.com/Products/Online-Training.aspx"><em>Light Bites Online Training Series</em></a>, a series of training modules that cover a variety of fiber optic topics, both introductory and advanced.<br />
        <br />
        Like other Light Brigade courses, the Light Bites modules feature high-quality images, animations, charts, and reference material that enhance the learning experience and help to reinforce important concepts. The modules are user-friendly, can be completed in 60 to 90 minutes, and feature easy-to-use stop, pause and rewind controls. <br />
        <br />
        The first module of the <em>Light Bites Training Series </em>to be available is <em>Single-mode Technology: Theory and Fibers</em>. A good understanding of fiber optic theory is critical for anyone working in fiber optics, and this module goes beyond the fundamentals to provide an even deeper understanding of how optical theory applies to single-mode fibers and applications. Key topics include attenuation, dispersion, wavelength, windows and bands, and industry standards. The module also examines related applications and technologies, and details how different types of single-mode fibers are designed to address specific requirements. It concludes with a review quiz to ensure mastery of the content. Those who successfully pass the quiz will receive a Light Brigade certificate of completion.<br />
        <br />
        “Along with our Certified Fiber to the Home Professional course, this first module is just the beginning of our online learning plans,” said Lee Kellett, general manager of Light Brigade. “We understand that education needs to come in many different forms today. Light Bites will be an easy way for anyone to get quality fiber optic education where and when they need it.”<br />
        <em>Single-mode Technology: Theory and Fibers</em> may be purchased on the <a href="https://www.lightbrigade.com/Products/Online-Training.aspx">Light Brigade website</a> at a limited time introductory price.<br />
