        Spartanburg, SC - AFL announces that the Imagination Library, operating under United Way of the Piedmont, is the recipient of a $5,000 Fujikura Foundation grant in support of enrolling more children in to the program. Imagination Library is an early literacy program that helps prepare children for success in school by eliminating one of the reasons children do not read – access to books.<br />
        <br />
        “We’re so excited about providing a grant to Imagination Library, supporting young children in Spartanburg County,” stated Corie Culp, Community Relations Manager for AFL. “It’s essential that we help our children by engaging them at an early age. Doing so enriches our community and our future.”<br />
        <br />
        Imagination Library provides a free, age appropriate book to enrolled children once each month from birth to age five. The books included in the library are updated yearly by a team of nationally renowned experts in early childhood education.<br />
        <br />
        “Investment in Imagination Library is an investment in our community’s future,” stated Kathy Dunleavy, President and CEO of the United Way of the Piedmont. “We believe it instills a love of books, a love of reading and more parental involvement….all the right ingredients for school-readiness. We appreciate being chosen as a recipient of this grant.”<br />
        <br />
        Assuming a child is enrolled at birth, each child will have a vibrant library of 60 books at their fifth birthday. Books are received via the US Postal Service and addressed directly to the child. For additional information on Imagination Library, visit http://www.uwpiedmont.org/imaginationlibrary.php.<br />
