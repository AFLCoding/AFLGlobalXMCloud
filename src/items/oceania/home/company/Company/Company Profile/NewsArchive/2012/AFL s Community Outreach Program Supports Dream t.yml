        AFL’s Community Advisory Board presented a $5,000 grant to Dream !t Do !t South Carolina (DIDI SC) to commemorate Governor Nikki Haley’s visit to AFL and in celebration of its recent expansion and investment in Spartanburg. AFL is giving back to the manufacturing community by supporting DIDI SC, an organization that supports advanced manufacturing careers. The grant specifically funds “Education and Economic Development 101” where educators learn more about how the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) curricula apply in industry.<br />
        <br />
        “As a successful manufacturer headquartered in Spartanburg, SC, we are grateful for the opportunities our community has provided us over the past 28 years. AFL manufactures technologically advanced fiber optic products for multiple markets and the opportunities that lie before us are abundant. We continuously seek qualified applicants with advanced skills and talent. Supporting Dream !t Do !t SC is one way we can give back to help all manufacturers in the state who have the same need we do—associates who possess these technical skills and have a passion to be a part of a manufacturing career,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL.<br />
        <br />
        Cherie Pressley, Director, Upstate Regional Education Center, and Stuart Smith, Board Chair, Upstate Regional Education Center, accepted the check on behalf of the South Carolina Business Center for Excellence in Education Foundation, of which Dream !t Do !t SC resides.<br />
        <br />
        “We greatly appreciate AFL supporting teachers going into industry over the summer and learning how the STEM curricula are used in business,” said Cherie Pressley. “In turn, they will be better equipped to help students apply their knowledge and understand their career options.”<br />
