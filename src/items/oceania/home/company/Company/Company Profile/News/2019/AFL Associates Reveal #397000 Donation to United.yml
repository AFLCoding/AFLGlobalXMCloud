        <div>Spartanburg, SC – June 3, 2019 – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a global manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, celebrated the end of its annual United Way campaign with a $397,000 donation to <a href="http://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a>. Made possible by AFL associates and AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>, this year’s donation surpassed the previous years’ by 38 percent. The number of donors increased by nine percent over last year with associates donating more than $304K to the community. AFL supplements all associates’ donations with a dollar for dollar match up to $100.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        “We have been blown away by the generosity of our associates,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “They stretched themselves this year and it resulted in the largest donation to date for our community! This campaign will truly touch the lives of children and families and make an impact for years to come.”<br />
         <br />
        This year’s United Way campaign theme was “Game On!” and featured various gaming concepts. Associates learned about <a href="http://www.hopecfc.org/index.php">Hope Center for Children</a>, a United Way-funded agency that builds stable, healthy families and provides children a safe place from abuse and neglect, through a video highlighting the organization’s different programs. The campaign continued for two weeks and included game-themed cupcakes, incentives that included vacation days, prizes and the final reveal event.  <br />
         <br />
        In 2018, AFL presented a check to United Way of the Piedmont for $287,000. In 2017, AFL associates presented $237,000. This year’s increase over the previous year marks the largest jump in the history of AFL’s United Way campaigns.<br />
         <br />
        AFL has an extensive Community Outreach Program that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more. For additional information on AFL and its community initiatives, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
