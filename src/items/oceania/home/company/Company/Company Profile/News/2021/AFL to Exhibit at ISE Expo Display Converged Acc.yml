        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an industry leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment, and accessories, is exhibiting and presenting&nbsp;live&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href="https://iseexpo.com/">ISE Expo</a>&nbsp;in Fort Worth, Texas, September 1 &ndash; 2. Visit AFL in booth #521 to see how AFL provides an end-to-end&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F1301270926A41D59CDF21EDDD559208&amp;_z=z">Converged Access Network solution</a>&nbsp;that includes its newest product releases consisting of&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BD16F0851A334911A1C25E3194A9D166&amp;_z=z">Apex&reg; Fiber Optic Splice Closures</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A03F89FAD98433B834F37F07F87DD1C&amp;_z=z">Fujikura 90S+ Fusion Splicer,</a>&nbsp;plus test equipment such as the&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A1055BC9C33B40258E0F1C3DAC9D2B44&amp;_z=z">FlexScan&reg; FTTH PON Troubleshooter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=687F71F3779D4D23BA9003F7A36FE074&amp;_z=z">VFI4 Visual Fault Identifier</a>.<br />
        AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;Converged Access Network&nbsp;is built to be expandable, flexible, and accessible to meet the growing demands of the future. AFL&rsquo;s solution can help build a network in a range of application areas including 5G Fronthaul/Backhaul, FTTX, Multiple Dwelling Unit (MXU), Campuses and Venues, Enterprise, and Central Office. Learn more about Converged Access Networks and 5G by attending the seminar titled, &ldquo;Lighting Up 5G &ndash; the Future-Ready Access Network.&rdquo; Presented by Josh Simer, AFL Market Manager, wireline service providers will learn how to position themselves to gain the most from future opportunities by making effective use of new technologies for access network construction.&nbsp;<a href="https://iseexpo.com/sessions/lighting-up-5g-the-future-ready-access-network/">Register here</a>.<br />

        AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;Apex splice closures&nbsp;are designed to lower overall installation time with easier-to-use sealing and cable retention methods. With a wedge-based gel sealing system, installation time is drastically decreased. The Apex X-2 and X-2S splice closure sizes have maximum capacities of 1,728 and 3,456 fibers, respectively, when using 200 &micro;m SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg;. AFL&rsquo;s Apex splice closure will be highlighted on stage in the&nbsp;ISE Expo Demo Zone&nbsp;on September 2, 8:00 a.m. &ndash; 9:00 a.m. Central.<br />
        <br />
        Stop by booth #521 to see demonstrations of the new&nbsp;Fujikura 90S+ core alignment fusion splicer&nbsp;with Active Fusion Control (AFC) technology. This technology improves splice losses for fibers that possess a poor cleave angle and prevents bad splices due to a poorly maintained cleaver. The 90S+ can be used in multiple field splicing applications such as bend-insensitive fibers in drop cables, long-haul terrestrial and submarine LEAF&reg; fibers, loose buffer fiber, splice-on connectors, and more.<br />
        <br />
        Both AFL&rsquo;s new&nbsp;VFI4 Visual Fault Identifier&nbsp;and&nbsp;FlexScan TS100 Optical Troubleshooter&nbsp;will be demonstrated as well. The FlexScan TS100 troubleshooter is an easy-to-use, all-in-one tool for detecting, identifying, locating, and resolving single-mode optical network issues. The FlexScan TS100 automates testing, shortens test time, interprets results, and recommends corrective actions. The result is improved efficiency of frontline technicians and reduced costs. AFL&rsquo;s VFI4 injects high-powered red-laser light to provide exceptional brightness and range for locating defects in single-mode and multimode fibers. The universal connector interface mates with many connector styles without needing an adapter.<br />
