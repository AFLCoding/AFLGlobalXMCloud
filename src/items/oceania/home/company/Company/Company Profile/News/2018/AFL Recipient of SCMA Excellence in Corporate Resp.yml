        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading fiber optic manufacturer and provider of services, is a recipient of the 2018 Excellence in Corporate Responsibility award presented by the <a href="https://myscma.com/">South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance</a> (SCMA). This award recognizes the positive contributions manufacturers make in their local communities. The three categories of this award are Community Involvement & Philanthropy, Environmental Safety and Wellness & Safety.<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/SCMA_pr.aspx" target="_blank"></a><br />
        <br />
        “Every year, we commit to being a good steward of our community, to support workforce development initiatives and to keep EHS a top priority,” said Kurt Dallas, executive vice president of AFL. “We are honored to receive this award along with many other manufacturers in South Carolina as it reaffirms these are the right focus areas that have measureable impact in the upstate and throughout the state.”<br />
         <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants, sponsorships, volunteer projects, disaster relief and more. Most notable of AFL’s achievements is its United Way campaign. AFL associates had a record-breaking campaign with a $237K donation to the community (inclusive of associates’ donations and AFL’s match) for a total economic impact of $1,734,840. AFL is now in the top 7 UWP campaigns. Among manufacturing companies in Spartanburg, Cherokee and Union with 250+ employees, AFL ranks #1 in per capita giving; #2 in participation rate; and #3 in leadership donors.<br />
         <br />
        Most recently, AFL launched the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8A47BDB2CFCC486D80AB31035D7593D0&_z=z">Operational Workforce Program</a>. We are working with current high school students seeking to gain manufacturing certificates and join our immediate production workforce after graduation. AFL partners with local community colleges to build apprentice programs where trade students gain classroom knowledge simultaneously working part time to gain on the job maintenance and technical experience.<br />
         <br />
        <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=42FDC709BA964169AF29F0445E1F59A1&_z=z">Environment, Health & Safety</a> is one of AFL’s Core Values. AFL has comprehensive EHS policies and procedures that aim to go well above and beyond standards compliance. Our approach involves a continuous improvement model utilizing internal and external auditing and actively engaged employees who are encouraged and incentivized to identify and report hazards they observe in our workplaces.<br />
