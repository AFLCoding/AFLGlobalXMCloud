        <div>Spartanburg, SC  – <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=CB5A0B73F40540109C53688EDA61E0F7&_z=z">AFL</a> is partnering with <a href="https://www.habitatgreenville.org/">Habitat for Humanity of Greenville County</a>, this time in support of its <a href="https://www.habitatgreenville.org/get-involved/homes-for-heroes">Homes for Heroes</a> program. This program works to support deserving veteran families who are in need of affordable housing after returning from active duty. Through AFL’s Community Outreach Program, Habitat Greenville received $15K to support a local veteran family, the Rush’s, and their new home.<br />
        “Those who sacrifice to serve our country face many struggles after their time on active duty,” explained Monroe Free, President & CEO for Habitat for Humanity of Greenville. “The Homes for Heroes program aims to alleviate the struggle of finding affordable housing.”<br />
        <br />
        One of every four veterans faces housing cost burdens. Many veterans also face disabilities, which makes finding accessible housing even more difficult. Additionally, there is a large number of veterans who are single mothers, who often spend a third of their income just to house their families.<br />
        <br />
        Homes for Heroes provides a home for a veteran and their family and sets them on a path to secure and affordable home ownership. Habitat provides them with the strength and stability needed to build a new future for themselves and their families. Habitat also provides homeowner education classes to help with future needs.<br />
        <br />
        “Families in our program have not had a solid foundation on which to build their lives,” Free said. “We are committed to creating and sustaining a vibrant, healthy county and improving life opportunities for its most vulnerable citizens.”<br />
        <br />
        The home for the Rush family was dedicated today.<br />
        <br />
