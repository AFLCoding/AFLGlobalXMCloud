        <p>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturing of fiber optic cable and equipment, is launching the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=750EE63900404AB2B3DDC1AB825DD815&amp;_z=z">Fujikura 41S+ fusion splicer</a>&nbsp;in North America. The 41S+ is a fully ruggedized, two camera, active cladding alignment fusion splicer featuring Active Fusion Control (AFC) technology. This technology reduces reburns and improves splice losses for fibers with poor cleave angles.</p>
        &ldquo;Keeping equipment in the field clean and in pristine operating condition at all times is a challenging task. Active Fusion Control helps alleviate this pain point by improving splice loss for even poorly prepared fibers,&rdquo; explained Lucas Mays, Associate Product Manager for AFL&rsquo;s Fusion Splicing Systems. &ldquo;High cleave angles are typically a major thorn in a technician&rsquo;s side, especially for newer users still adjusting to the nuances of fusion splicing. They can come from several factors but namely, a dull or dirty cleaver. Active Fusion Control reduces splice loss to industry acceptable standards even with non-ideal prepped fiber, giving operators greater confidence in the splices they install.&rdquo;
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
        Enabled by Warm Splice Imaging (WSI) technology, the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=750EE63900404AB2B3DDC1AB825DD815&amp;_z=z">41S+</a>&nbsp;can also determine the alignment of the fiber cores by observing the splice during the heating process, delivering splice loss estimates with a greater level of accuracy than those based on cladding only alignment. Additionally, by using Active Blade Management (ABM) via Bluetooth&reg; with the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EC9760CA48424C4BB3FC3F636E8227E5&amp;_z=z">CT50 Fiber Cleaver</a>, blade rotation usage is tracked and rotated as needed. Using ABM and AFC together reduces the likelihood of poor splice installations or repairs.</p>
        <p>
        Additional features of the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=750EE63900404AB2B3DDC1AB825DD815&amp;_z=z">Fujikura 41S+</a>&nbsp;include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            6-second splice time and 25-second shrink time for speed and productivity</li>
            <li>
            Easy-to-use touchscreen monitor for simple and intuitive menu navigation</li>
            <li>
            Interchangeable sheath clamps or fiber holders for versatility and compatibility with splice-on connectors</li>
            <li>
            Extended-life battery for up to 200 splice and heat cycles</li>
            <li>
            Long-life electrodes that provide 5,000 splices to minimize downtime</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A91A74231BE243CE8B5846A357943634&amp;_z=z">Software updates</a> can be completed via AFL&rsquo;s website and allow users easy access for updating software as new splice programs become available.</p>
