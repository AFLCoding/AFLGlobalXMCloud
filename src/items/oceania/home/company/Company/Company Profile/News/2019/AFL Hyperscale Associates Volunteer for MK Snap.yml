        <div>Milton Keynes, UK and Spartanburg, SC – July 16, 2019 – <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3ACE1DA2BD41439D95F451A80754116B&_z=z">AFL Hyperscale</a> associates volunteered to restore a neglected pond on the grounds of <a href="https://mksnap.org/">MK Snap</a>, an organization that provides education, life skills, work preparation and opportunities to adults with learning disabilities. Three teams volunteered over three days to reestablish the pond and inject “sensory magic,” various items used for education, stimulation and relaxation. Part of an <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/ACT-Project.aspx">ACT</a> (AFL Community Team) initiative, the teams provided labor as well as funding to support the initiative.  <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        “AFL has financially supported MK Snap with grants over the past couple of years, but to dedicate time to support their efforts is even more meaningful,” said Daniel Brown, channel development manager with AFL Hyperscale. "I'm a keen fish keeper and was thrilled to be able to revamp the pond and introduce some fish for the learners at the centre."<br />
        <br />
        MK Snap makes it key to provide energy, creativity and pride that will light up the lives of adults with learning difficulties. MK Snap offers local teams the opportunity to give back to the local community and tailors projects to suit certain requirements.<br />
        <br />
        "Fun is in our DNA and we are always happy to create unique ways to engage and motivate teams," states Angie Novel, CEO of MK Snap. "AFL associates went above and beyond our expectations and I know our clients will enjoy this pond and garden for years to come.”<br />
        <br />
        MK works with charities, voluntary organizations and community groups in Milton Keynes, providing a wide range of services including development, governance and funding advice, training and networking opportunities and community engagement. Their mission is to educate, empower and enable people and groups to champion the change they wish to see in the community.<br />
