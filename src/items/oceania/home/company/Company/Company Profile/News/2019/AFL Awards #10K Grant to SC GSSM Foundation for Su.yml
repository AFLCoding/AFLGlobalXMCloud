        <div>Spartanburg, SC – July 16, 2019 – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, presented a $10K grant to the <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/">SC Governor’s School for Science & Mathematics</a> (GSSM), a public high school for students who have an interest in pursuing advanced studies in science, technology, engineering and math. The grant, made possible by AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>, supported two summer programs, <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/camps/iteams-xtreme-next-generation">iTEAMS Xtreme: Next Generation</a> and <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/camps/createng">CREATEng</a>, providing financial aid for up to 50 participants to attend the GSSM camps. In 2019, seventeen camps were held across the state of South Carolina.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        “Both camps stimulate innovative thinking and are customized to engage and inspire participants, including those with no prior knowledge,” commented Elizabeth Dinndorf, J.D., executive director of the GSSM Foundation. “We feel certain that their camp experience will continue to impact their lives and the South Carolina economy for years to come.”<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/camps/iteams-xtreme-next-generation">iTEAMS Xtreme: Next Generation</a> is a week-long computer science and robotics camp that serves rising 6th, 7th and 8th grade students. Campers program microcontrollers to operate robots, explore the Internet of Things (IoT), and grow their digital communication skills. Activities included robot World Cup soccer tournament in addition to creating laser security games and a digitally-connected smart home.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/camps/createng">CREATEng</a> camps serve rising 8th and 9th grade students. Students applied the principles of engineering design to solve challenges through the lens of NASA engineers colonizing Mars. They built wind-proof structures, designed rover all-terrain vehicle wheels, and created bridges one might encounter on the red planet’s surface.<br />
        <br />
        Dinndorf continued, “Students are immersed in STEM experiences and discover new career opportunities that ignite a passion for pursuing STEM studies.”<br />
        <br />
        GSSM hires and trains local teachers to serve at the camps each year. Teachers return to their classrooms armed with additional knowledge and skills obtained during training and camp experiences.<br />
