        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a> is introducing two new fusion splicer models, the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=750EE63900404AB2B3DDC1AB825DD815&_z=z">Fujikura 41S Core Sensing fusion splicer</a> and the 31S. Both feature touchscreen technology and active cladding alignment capability, simplifying use and greatly reducing the need for rigorous cleaning in typical field conditions. The Fujikura 41S adds more accurate core sensing loss estimation capabilities enabled by Warm Splice Imaging (WSI) and incorporates active cleaver management via Bluetooth® technology.  </p>
        <div>
        “Fujikura has again raised the bar with these new Fujikura fusion splicers. The core sensing loss estimation technology of the 41S redefines what users can expect from a cladding alignment splicer,” commented Greg Pickeral, product manager for AFL’s fusion splicing systems.<br />
         <br />
        The Fujikura 41S model enhanced loss estimation technology allows evaluation of core alignment during the splice and unprecedented accuracy with a cladding alignment type splicer. The splicer also features Bluetooth communication for use with the new <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EC9760CA48424C4BB3FC3F636E8227E5&_z=z">CT50 fiber cleaver</a>. In an industry first, cleaver blade positions can be advanced automatically based on cleave quality assessment in the 41S splicer. Both the 41S and 31S models offer legendary Fujikura ruggedness and quality.<br />
         <br />
        Pickeral continued, “Adding the Bluetooth communication with the CT50 fiber cleaver not only revolutionizes maintenance when the need arises, but also maximizes the blade life as well.”<br />
         <br />
        The touchscreen technology of these splicers provide a convenient method to navigate device menus. The six-second splice time combined with a twenty-five second heating time increases productivity. Both models are equipped with removable sheath clamps allowing users to utilize fiber holders if desired.<br />
         <br />
