        <div>Spartanburg, SC – June 27, 2019 – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, presented a $15K grant to the <a href="https://www.middletyger.org/">Middle Tyger Community Center</a> (MTCC), an organization that helps provide health, education, and family support to cultivate lives in the community. Made possible by <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">AFL’s Community Outreach Program</a>, the grant will provide financial assistance to its Family Counseling Center to support families in the community.
        “We do not currently have therapists who specialize in treating children under 10 years of age, and our program has limited availability for adolescents,” commented Tina Gaudiano, senior program director MTCC. “This grant from AFL will give us the opportunity to provide a certified therapist capable of serving our community.”<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="https://www.middletyger.org/">Middle Tyger Community Center</a> opened to the public in 1998 and provides comprehensive services to the community including early childhood education, family counseling services, youth development programs, a food pantry, free health clinic and adult education programs. MTCC has become a model for holistic, integrated family support services in Spartanburg County.  <br />
        <br />
        Gaudiano continued, “Even very young children may show early warning signs of mental health concerns. Between 2016 and 2019, the number of adolescents who have experienced at least one major depressive episode increased 60 percent.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Community Outreach Program includes grants, sponsorships, volunteer and environment initiatives, disaster relief, scholarships and more. For additional information on AFL, its products and services, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
