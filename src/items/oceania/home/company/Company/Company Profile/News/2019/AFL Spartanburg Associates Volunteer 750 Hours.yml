        <div style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;">Spartanburg, SC – Each year, <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">AFL</a> associates around the world take part in giving back to their communities, engaging in projects that support nonprofit organizations while investing in their future. Nearly 200 associates from AFL in Spartanburg volunteered their time at nine different organizations throughout September and early October.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        “Venturing out into the community and providing hands-on support allows each AFL volunteer to learn more about the organizations we are supporting and the needs of those around us,” explained Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Several employees commented that they had no idea these organizations and services even existed. It’s an eye-opening experience for many.”<br />
        <br />
        Volunteers kicked off the month with <a href="https://www.hubcityfm.org/" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">Hub City Farmers Market</a> (HCFM) whose mission is to increase supply, demand and access to healthy, local food in Spartanburg County. Associates helped raise a new greenhouse on their property and tend to the grounds. HCFM makes weekly visits to the AFL campus with its mobile market.<br />
        <br />
        Three volunteer teams supported <a href="https://www.harvesthope.org/" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">Harvest Hope</a>, an organization that provides for the needs of hungry people by gathering and sharing quality food with dignity, compassion and education. Volunteers sorted food and “shopped” for clients on those days, learning more about how the organization operates, who its partners are and what they need.<br />
        <br />
        A large team from AFL volunteered with <a href="https://www.julievalentinecenter.org/" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">Julie Valentine Center</a> in Greenville, an organization whose mission is to stop sexual violence and child abuse and the impact of these crimes through prevention, investigation, collaboration, treatment and advocacy. Volunteers provided landscaping and cleaning support for the Center. Additionally, associates volunteered at the <a href="http://www.hopecfc.org/index.php" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">Hope Center for Children</a> in Spartanburg by disposing of an old playground set and painting an office. The Hope Center for Children takes a stand against child abuse and neglect in Upstate communities by building stable, healthy families and providing children a safe place from abuse and neglect.<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="https://palmettoconservation.org/" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">Palmetto Conservation Foundation</a> hosted a group of AFL volunteers for its annual ‘True to the Brew’ half marathon. Its mission is to conserve South Carolina’s natural and cultural resources, preserve historic landmarks and promote active outdoor recreation on the Palmetto Trail and other greenways. AFL associates help prep pre-race, served during the race and cleaned up post-race.<br />
        <br />
        At <a href="https://hoperemains.org/" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">Hope Remains Ranch</a> two groups of volunteers supported their needs. AFL’s interns and co-ops provided support for a school group that was visiting one day while another AFL team provided landscaping needs including weeding, mulching and planting. Hope Remains Ranch provides equine therapy to children who have experienced traumatic events as well as wrap around support for the entire family.<br />
        <br />
        Volunteers also partnered with <a href="https://www.habitatspartanburg.org/" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">Habitat for Humanity of Spartanburg</a> and <a href="https://www.habitatgreenville.org/" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">Habitat for Humanity of Greenville</a> on various builds in the area. From framing to insulating, volunteers provided sweat equity to build a home for a family. Habitat for Humanity provides housing for families, enabling them to build a stable future as part of our community.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://greerrelief.org/" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">Greer Relief</a> was also supported by AFL associates. Volunteers supported the organization’s annual golf tournament pre-tournament to post-tournament by assembling bags, loading supplies, setting up, serving water and more.   <br />
         <br />
        AFL Spartanburg associates volunteered approximately 750 hours during its annual Month of Service, equating to approximately $19K in volunteer service given to multiple organizations. Around the world, AFL associates donated nearly 1,200 hours of volunteer service.<br />
        <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more.
