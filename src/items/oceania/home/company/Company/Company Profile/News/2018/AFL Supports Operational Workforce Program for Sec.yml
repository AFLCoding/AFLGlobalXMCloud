        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories is continuing its Operational Workforce Program into 2019 with ten students joining the program from <a href="https://www.spart5.net/bhs">Byrnes High School</a>. Through a partnership with <a href="https://www.sccsc.edu/home/">Spartanburg Community College (SCC)</a>, the training program offers these students an introduction to manufacturing. Classes are provided at Byrnes High School by SCC professors.</p>
        <div>
        “As a sponsor of this program, AFL is able to partake in training the next generation of manufacturing associates,” explained Ryan Burns, human resources director for AFL. “The course gives students a great springboard into our manufacturing workforce.”  <br />
        <br />
        AFL pioneered the first Operational Workforce Program in Spartanburg in late 2017 when 20 students toured AFL and 10 were selected from interviews to join the program in January 2018. Four students completed the program and are now employed by AFL. Ten students are enrolled for the January 2019 semester.<br />
        <br />
        Burns continued, “The landscape has changed and AFL is now competing with local manufacturers for headcount. This program helps to create awareness of who we are and our impact in the community as well as abroad.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL began operations in Spartanburg County in 1984, manufacturing one product, Optical Ground Wire. Since then it has expanded its product portfolio to include additional fiber optic cable, connectors, fiber management systems, test and inspection equipment, education, training, services and more.
