        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> awarded a $3,500 grant to <a href="http://www.tcmupstate.org/">The Children’s Museum of the Upstate</a> (TCMU) in support of the FIRST® LEGO® League. Made possible by <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">AFL’s Community Outreach Program</a>, the grant will aid the museum’s after-school programs to help educate and engage children in STEM education.<br />
        <br />
        TCMU’s FIRST® LEGO® League program provides children the opportunity to learn more about science and engineering and how it impacts everyday life, with the hope of sparking an interest at a young age. FIRST® LEGO® League teams include fourth through eighth graders and engage students in collaboration and innovative thinking and problem-solving.<br />
        <br />
        “The goal is to not only engage children in STEM fields, but to teach them that communal gain and competition are not separate goals, but one that promotes working together and respecting one another,” said Jami Wood Emory, director of development for The Children’s Museum of the Upstate. “Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition, which is a combination of competition and cooperation, are key to the Core Values of the leagues.”<br />
        <br />
        TCMU has coached and hosted many teams that have gained increasing success in the past couple of years. For the 2017-2018 group, the FIRST® LEGO® League team received first place in the CU-ICAR Regional Qualifier and was invited to participate in the state championship this past January.<br />
        <br />
