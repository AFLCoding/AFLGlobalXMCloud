        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, has awarded $11,200 in grants to two nonprofit organizations through its <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=54B66AA7D20E440A829E3731F31C91D4&_z=z">Volunteers Choose</a> program. This program allows AFL associates who volunteered for a company-sponsored outreach project in the past year to vote on a grant recipient for 2019. Volunteers chose the Hope Center for Children and Hope Remains Ranch as recipients.
        The <a href="http://www.hopecfc.org/">Hope Center for Children’s</a> mission is to build stable, healthy families and provide children a safe place from abuse and neglect. The Hope Center for Children works to equip parents with the tools they need to overcome barriers and to teach strong values and life skills to their children. They also provide around-the-clock care and teaching to children when their homes are not safe for them. Services include: home visitation and prevention-focused case management, emergency shelter, longer term residential care for girls in foster care and finally, services to support a transition back to family life and better ensure that the child is able to thrive. The Hope Center for Children received a $7,600 grant.<br />
        <br />
        Volunteers also chose <a href="https://hoperemains.org/">Hope Remains Ranch</a>, an organization that provides counseling, mentoring and equine therapy for youth, families and adults. Their programs offer those they serve a second chance, and utilize the “wrap around” approach by serving the entire family and offering support care. The goals of their programs are to provide a new sense of confidence, responsibility, accountability, sensitivity to others, and discipline in their conduct for everyone they serve. Hope Remains Ranch received a $3,600 grant.<br />
        <br />
        “Last year, our associates again demonstrated their commitment to making a lasting impact in our community,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Community outreach has become a significant part of AFL’s culture, and these grants are a reflection of their dedication.”<br />
