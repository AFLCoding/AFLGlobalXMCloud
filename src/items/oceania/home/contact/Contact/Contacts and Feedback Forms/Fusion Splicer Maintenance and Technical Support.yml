        <h2>Naturally, the best splicers should come with the best service and support in the world</h2>
        <p>Fujikura has been making the most reliable and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6E69EBAD0FB443C1B654824CADFCD096&_z=z">hardest working splicers</a> in the industry since the beginning of splicing. Even with the most dependable and safest splicers in the market, we realize they still need to be serviced and taken care of. Your splicer isn’t much help if it goes down in the field. That's why AFL offers the fastest turnaround time of any splicer manufacturer and we will have you back in the field before the other guys would have even looked at your splicer. We do this because of our team and their passion. In fact, some of our techs have been with AFL longer than some new splicer manufacturers have even been in business!</p>
        <p>
        AFL employs a world-class team <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Contact/Splicers/Splicer-Support-Team.aspx" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;"></a>of Fujikura qualified engineers and technicians to provide both product and technical support. Our team has the know-how and experience to troubleshoot splicer problems over the phone, often avoiding the inconvenience and expense of having to send a unit in. In the event that a repair is needed, our splicer repair facility stocks all of the necessary components to repair and ship splicers in less than one day in the vast majority of cases, meaning that if repairs are needed, our customers will go without their splicer for as little time as possible. </p>
        <p>The best part? Technical support is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week by dialing one of the numbers below.<br />
