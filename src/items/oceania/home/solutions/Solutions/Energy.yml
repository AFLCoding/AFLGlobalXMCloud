        <h3>
        	Optical Ground Wire Cable</h3>
        <div>
        	AFL was a leader in the development and launch of this product back in 1985 when they discovered that electric transmission lines provided an ideal route for a telecommunications path. Today, AFL boasts the world’s largest OPGW product portfolio and highest total capacity with facilities situated throughout the world to satisfy the needs of the global market. AFL also manufactures its own line of attachment hardware which simplifies the network design phase of a project while ensuring compatibility between the cable and related components.</div>
        <div>
        	<br />
        	OPGW is primarily used by the electric utility industry, placed in the secure topmost position of the transmission line where it “shields” the all-important conductors from lightning while providing a telecommunications path for internal as well as third party communications.</div>
        <ul>
        	<li>
        		 For use by electric utilities on transmission lines in lieu of traditional shield wire</li>
        	<li>
        		 For retrofit applications where existing shield wire needs to be replaced with OPGW</li>
        	<li>
        		 For new transmission lines in lieu of traditional shield wire</li>
        	<li>
        		 Hermetically sealed tubes provide mechanical and thermal protection for optical fibre</li>
        	<li>
        		 High load and long span capability, with fibre counts up to 432 or more</li>
        	<li>
        		 Stranded wires selected to optimise mechanical and electrical properties of cable</li>
        	<li>
        		 Light-weight cables for optimised renewable energy applications</li>
        	<li>
        		 Full line of attachment hardware available for a system solution</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
        	SkyWrap®</h3>
        <div>
        	SkyWrap provides a retro-fit solution for installing a fibre optic cable on overhead power lines. A specially designed spinning machine is used to wrap the cable under controlled conditions. This system offers a complete communication link designed and engineered for high-voltage environments at low cost. The cable is small and imposes minimal additional load on the overhead line conductors, poles and towers. The installation technique means that SkyWrap can be deployed quickly and cost-effectively, increasing network fibre capacity with minimum disruption to electricity supply services.</div>
        <div>
        	 </div>
        <div>
        	SkyWrap was first installed in 1982 and has an excellent reputation for reliable and secure operation in more than 40 countries around the world. The success of SkyWrap is derived from the speed, manoeuvrability and low impact on the Cable Energy 3 environment. It requires fewer people and much less equipment to install the cable, which provides:</div>
        <ul>
        	<li>
        		Quick, cost effective installation</li>
        	<li>
        		Utilize existing power line infrastructure</li>
        	<li>
        		Use for both earth-wires and phase conductors</li>
        	<li>
        		Live line installations on earth-wire</li>
        	<li>
        		Meets IEEE 1594 Specification</li>
