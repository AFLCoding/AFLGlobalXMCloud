        <p>As the first telecommunications company to offer a lifetime warranty* on end-to-end fiber optic systems, AFL partners with system integrators that possess the same quality of workmanship as we do. We carefully select partners that are as stringent about quality workmanship as we are at AFL. Plus, we are continually building our network of&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Contact/AFL-ACE-Partners.aspx" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;"> AFL Certified Expert (ACE) Installers</a> that design and install AFL systems.</p>
