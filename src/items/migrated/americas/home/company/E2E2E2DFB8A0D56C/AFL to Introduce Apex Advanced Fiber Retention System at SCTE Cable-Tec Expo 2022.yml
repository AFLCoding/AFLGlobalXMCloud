Its V-Clip reduces installation time and frustration associated with tie wraps. Additionally, the Mesh Tubes in the kit are designed to protect ribbon fiber in mesh tubing between splice trays. When paired with Apex Sealed Splice Closures, AFRS saves time when installing and routing high-density fiber optic cables. </span></p>
        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: black;">Apex Sealed Splice Closures are designed to improve usability, decrease installation time, increase network reliability and increase density of fiber splices. Featuring a unique wedge-based sealing system with cable strain relief, cables are installed into the closure and sealed in seconds. Loose tube and ribbon cables can be installed together within the same closure. Apex closures protect optical fiber splices in both above- and below-grade applications in a butt configuration. <span style="background: white;">The </span></span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Splice-Closures/Apex-Fiber-Optic-Splice-Closures/Apex-X-2-Sealed-Splice-Closure"><span style="background: white; color: #00b0f0;">Apex X-2</span></a><span style="background: white; color: black;"> and </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Splice-Closures/Apex-Fiber-Optic-Splice-Closures/Apex-X-2S-Sealed-Splice-Closure"><span style="background: white; color: #00b0f0;">X-2S</span></a><span style="background: white; color: #00b0f0;"> </span><span style="color: black;">splice closure sizes have maximum capacities of 3,456 and 1,728 fibers, respectively, when using 200 &micro;m SWR. </span></p>

NodeFLEX cable assemblies utilize a bendable boot with integrated steel wires, allowing a single product to cover both aerial and below-grade or pedestal applications. This flexible boot allows installers to flex the boot to an angle up to 90&deg; and hold that position for applications where 90&deg; entry is required. This eliminates the need for separate straight and 90&deg; node cables, thus reducing inventory and ordering complexity. </span></p>

        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span>AFL&rsquo;s new AFRS simplifies cable management by routing Loose Tube and Ribbon (Flat Matrix, SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg; (SWR&reg;), Tubed and Central Core) Cable between Apex splice trays. Its V-Clip reduces installation time and frustration associated with tie wraps. Additionally, the Mesh Tubes in the kit are designed to protect ribbon fiber in mesh tubing between splice trays. When paired with Apex Sealed Splice Closures, AFRS saves time when installing and routing high-density fiber optic cables. </span></p>
        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: black;">Apex Sealed Splice Closures are designed to improve usability, decrease installation time, increase network reliability and increase density of fiber splices. Featuring a unique wedge-based sealing system with cable strain relief, cables are installed into the closure and sealed in seconds. Loose tube and ribbon cables can be installed together within the same closure. Apex closures protect optical fiber splices in both above- and below-grade applications in a butt configuration. <span style="background: white;">The </span></span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Splice-Closures/Apex-Fiber-Optic-Splice-Closures/Apex-X-2-Sealed-Splice-Closure"><span style="background: white; color: #00b0f0;">Apex X-2</span></a><span style="background: white; color: black;"> and </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Splice-Closures/Apex-Fiber-Optic-Splice-Closures/Apex-X-2S-Sealed-Splice-Closure"><span style="background: white; color: #00b0f0;">X-2S</span></a><span style="background: white; color: #00b0f0;"> </span><span style="color: black;">splice closure sizes have maximum capacities of 3,456 and 1,728 fibers, respectively, when using 200 &micro;m SWR. </span></p>
        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="background: white; color: black;">AFL will also feature NodeFLEX Cable Assemblies, which are used to link the Optical Distribution Network to Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial Nodes. NodeFLEX cable assemblies utilize a bendable boot with integrated steel wires, allowing a single product to cover both aerial and below-grade or pedestal applications. This flexible boot allows installers to flex the boot to an angle up to 90&deg; and hold that position for applications where 90&deg; entry is required. This eliminates the need for separate straight and 90&deg; node cables, thus reducing inventory and ordering complexity. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%;"><span style="background: white; color: black;">Visit booth #7013 for demonstrations of the</span><span> Fujikura 90S+ with Active Fusion Control (AFC) technology. AFC technology improves splice losses for fibers that possess a poor cleave angle and prevents bad splices due to a poorly maintained cleaver. With the extended life of 300 splice and heat cycles, the 90S+ fusion splicer can be used in multiple field splicing applications such as bend-insensitive fibers in drop cables, long-haul terrestrial and submarine LEAF&reg; fibers, loose buffer fiber, splice-on connectors and more.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%;"><span style="background: white; color: black;">AFL will also showcase the FlexScan Quad OTDR, an all-in-one solution </span><span>capable of testing multimode and single-mode networks</span>, <span>while still detecting and measuring events less than two meters apart. Designed for both expert and novice technicians, the FlexScan Quad OTDR enables both groups to quickly, reliably and accurately detect, locate, identify and measure optical network components and faults in a range of environments.</span></p>
