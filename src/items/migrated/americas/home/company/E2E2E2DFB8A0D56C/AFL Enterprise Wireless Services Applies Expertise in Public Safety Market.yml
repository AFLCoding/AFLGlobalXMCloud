        Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an award-winning provider of engineering and installation services, and manufacturer of fiber optic product solutions, is supporting the public safety market by using its wireless expertise to aid first responders.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        AFL specializes in turnkey design and installation of Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) built to provide enhanced communication within arenas, stadiums, campuses, schools and more. Clear, uninterrupted communications within these buildings is critical for first responders who need to communicate with others in times of crisis. AFL recognizes the importance of keeping first responders connected and wants to apply its expertise where it matters most.<br />

        &ldquo;AFL has years of knowledge and expertise installing wireless networks, and over time, we realized that this expertise aligns really well with the public safety market,&rdquo; explained Sam Orendain, Founder of Optical Telecom Solutions, a division of AFL. &ldquo;Many buildings have areas where signals are weak and in public safety situations, it is critical that communication lines are strong. DAS makes that possible and we have the experience to install these systems.&rdquo;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        AFL recently participated in a real-world training exercise involving both the <a href="https://www.saferbuildings.org/">Safer Buildings Coalition</a>&trade;, a not-for-profit organization focused on ensuring effective in-building communication capabilities, and <a href="https://www.pctel.com/">PCTEL&reg;</a>, a global provider of test and measurement solutions. At the request of Chief Alan Perdue, Executive Director of Safer Building Coalition, PCTEL demonstrated its network testing software at Harding University High School in Charlotte, North Carolina&mdash;a building in which AFL installed a Public Safety DAS solution. The system was specifically installed to provide enhanced communications for first responders in the event of an emergency. PCTEL tested the accuracy of AFL&rsquo;s DAS installation and provided real-time feedback.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &ldquo;Our vision is to eliminate in-building wireless dead zones,&rdquo; said Chief Perdue. &ldquo;It is of utmost importance that all first responders have the ability to communicate over every device they utilize during an incident, and with the clearest signal possible. This demonstration proved that the solution AFL and PCTEL provides will enhance the safety of our first responders and fulfill that vision.&rdquo;<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an award-winning provider of engineering and installation services, and manufacturer of fiber optic product solutions, is supporting the public safety market by using its wireless expertise to aid first responders.<br />
         <br />
        AFL specializes in turnkey design and installation of Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) built to provide enhanced communication within arenas, stadiums, campuses, schools and more. Clear, uninterrupted communications within these buildings is critical for first responders who need to communicate with others in times of crisis. AFL recognizes the importance of keeping first responders connected and wants to apply its expertise where it matters most.<br />
        <br />

        <br />
        “AFL has years of knowledge and expertise installing wireless networks, and over time, we realized that this expertise aligns really well with the public safety market,” explained Sam Orendain, Founder of Optical Telecom Solutions, a division of AFL. “Many buildings have areas where signals are weak and in public safety situations, it is critical that communication lines are strong. DAS makes that possible and we have the experience to install these systems.”<br />
         <br />
        AFL recently participated in a real-world training exercise involving both the <a href="https://www.saferbuildings.org/">Safer Buildings Coalition</a>™, a not-for-profit organization focused on ensuring effective in-building communication capabilities, and <a href="https://www.pctel.com/">PCTEL®</a>, a global provider of test and measurement solutions. At the request of Chief Alan Perdue, Executive Director of Safer Building Coalition, PCTEL demonstrated its network testing software at Harding University High School in Charlotte, North Carolina—a building in which AFL installed a Public Safety DAS solution. The system was specifically installed to provide enhanced communications for first responders in the event of an emergency. PCTEL tested the accuracy of AFL’s DAS installation and provided real-time feedback.<br />
         <br />
        “Our vision is to eliminate in-building wireless dead zones,” said Chief Perdue. “It is of utmost importance that all first responders have the ability to communicate over every device they utilize during an incident, and with the clearest signal possible. This demonstration proved that the solution AFL and PCTEL provides will enhance the safety of our first responders and fulfill that vision.”<br />

         <br />
        AFL is proud to be a part of the Public Safety Communication community and is committed to developing world-class solutions that help to keep first responders connected during times of crisis. AFL was the recipient of the Safer Buildings Coalition 2021 <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/news/afl-recognized-by-safer-buildings-coalition-with-2021-project-of-the-year">Project of the Year</a> award for its installation at Fifth + Broadway, a 6-acre mixed-use development in downtown Nashville, Tennessee.<br />
         <br />
        From planning and assessment, to installing and commissioning, to maintaining and monitoring, AFL provides services that make it possible to communicate wherever and whenever needed.<br />
