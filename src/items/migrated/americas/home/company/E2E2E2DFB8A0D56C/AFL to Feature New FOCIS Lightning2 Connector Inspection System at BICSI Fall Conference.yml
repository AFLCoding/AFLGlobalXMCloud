The Fujikura 90R is the splicing solution to manage increased traffic, higher fiber counts and greater data demand. With automated splice start, tube heater, wind protector, cleave tracking and blade rotations for up to two cleavers at a time, this splicer frees up operator time for other fiber preparation steps. Additionally, user-replaceable V-grooves allow technicians to keep the splicer in the field for a longer period of time. When V-grooves can no longer be cleaned after extended use, or are accidentally damaged, technicians can resume splicing in minutes by installing the spare set included with a 90R.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: black;">Fujikura core alignment splicers have been the industry&rsquo;s mainstay for 40+ years and the 90S+ carries that tradition forward. AFC technology and Active Blade Management of the 90S+ improve splice losses for fibers that possess a poor cleave angle and reduce bad splices due to a poorly maintained cleaver. With the extended life of 300 splice and heat cycles, the 90S+ fusion splicer can be used in multiple field splicing applications such as bend-insensitive fibers in drop cables, long-haul terrestrial and submarine LEAF&reg; fibers, loose buffer fiber, splice-on connectors and more.</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: black;">AFL&rsquo;s new FOCIS Lightning2 simplifies connector and bulkhead inspection for service providers, enterprise and data center operators. Designed to quickly inspect multi-fiber and single-fiber connectors and adapters, this compact, self-contained inspection probe can perform industry standard and user-defined end-face cleanliness analysis at a rate of about one second per fiber, allowing network operators to efficiently inspect and validate their fiber connectivity. Its large, high-resolution LCD touch screen also improves visibility of MPO and single-fiber connectors for advanced analysis.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: black;">On the show floor, AFL will also feature the Apex Sealed Splice Closure. These closures are designed to decrease installation time with easier-to-use sealing and cable retention methods, increase network reliability and increase density of fiber splices, especially when coupled with AFL&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/High-Density/Premise-MicroCore#sort=date%20descending"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">MicroCore&reg; cable</span></a><span style="color: black;"> and </span><a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/service-provider/wrapping-tube-cable-powered-by-spiderweb-ribbon-technology"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC) with SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg; (SWR&reg;)</span></a><span style="color: black;">. Featuring a unique wedge-based sealing system with cable strain relief, cables are installed into the closure and sealed in seconds.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: black;">Visit booth #201 for demonstrations of the Fujikura 90R Ribbon Splicer with replaceable V-grooves and the Fujikura 90S+ Core Alignment Splicer with Active Fusion Control (AFC) technology. The Fujikura 90R is the splicing solution to manage increased traffic, higher fiber counts and greater data demand. With automated splice start, tube heater, wind protector, cleave tracking and blade rotations for up to two cleavers at a time, this splicer frees up operator time for other fiber preparation steps. Additionally, user-replaceable V-grooves allow technicians to keep the splicer in the field for a longer period of time. When V-grooves can no longer be cleaned after extended use, or are accidentally damaged, technicians can resume splicing in minutes by installing the spare set included with a 90R.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: black;">Fujikura core alignment splicers have been the industry&rsquo;s mainstay for 40+ years and the 90S+ carries that tradition forward. AFC technology and Active Blade Management of the 90S+ improve splice losses for fibers that possess a poor cleave angle and reduce bad splices due to a poorly maintained cleaver. With the extended life of 300 splice and heat cycles, the 90S+ fusion splicer can be used in multiple field splicing applications such as bend-insensitive fibers in drop cables, long-haul terrestrial and submarine LEAF&reg; fibers, loose buffer fiber, splice-on connectors and more.</span></p>
