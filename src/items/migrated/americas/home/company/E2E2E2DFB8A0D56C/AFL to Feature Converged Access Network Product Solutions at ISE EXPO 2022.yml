        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="background: white; color: black;">AFL will feature Apex Sealed Splice Closures</span><span style="background: white; color: #00b0f0;"> </span><span style="background: white; color: black;">at ISE EXPO. These closures are designed to lower overall installation time with easier-to-use sealing and cable retention methods. With a wedge-based gel sealing system, installation time is drastically decreased. The Apex X-2 and X-2S splice closure sizes have maximum capacities of 3,456 and 1,728 fibers, respectively, when using 200 &micro;m SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg;. </span></p>
        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="background: white; color: black;">AFL&rsquo;s NodeFLEX Cable Assemblies, which are used to link the Optical Distribution Network to Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial Nodes, will be on display. AFL's NodeFLEX cable assemblies utilize a bendable boot with integrated steel wires, allowing a single product to cover both aerial and below-grade or pedestal applications. This flexible boot allows installers to flex the boot to an angle up to 90&deg; and hold that position for applications where 90&deg; entry is required. This eliminates the need for separate straight and 90&deg; node cables, thus reducing inventory and ordering complexity. </span></p>
        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span>Visit booth #232 to see demonstrations of the Fujikura 90S+ with Active Fusion Control (AFC) technology. AFC technology improves splice losses for fibers that possess a poor cleave angle and prevents bad splices due to a poorly maintained cleaver. With the extended life of 300 splice and heat cycles, the 90S+ fusion splicer can be used in multiple field splicing applications such as bend-insensitive fibers in drop cables, long-haul terrestrial and submarine LEAF&reg; fibers, loose buffer fiber, splice-on connectors and more. </span></p>
        <p>AFL&rsquo;s FlexScan TS100 Optical Troubleshooter and VFI4 will also be showcased. The TS100 is an easy-to-use, all-in-one tool for detecting, identifying, locating and resolving single-mode optical network issues. Designed primarily for field technicians activating and maintaining broadband access networks, the TS100 requires minimal training and no OTDR experience, allowing even novice technicians to perform a single-ended test in under three seconds. </p>
        <p><span>Enabling technicians to quickly spot faults, AFL's VFI4 injects a high-powered red laser light that provides exceptional brightness and range for locating defects in single-mode and multimode fibers. This essential tool is used to identify and trace fibers during activation and installation, identify poorly mated connectors, verify AFL&rsquo;s FASTConnect&reg; field-installable connector installation and find faults inside OTDR dead zones.</span></p>
        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span>Lastly, <span style="background: white; color: black;">Se&aacute;n Adam, AFL Vice President of Market Strategy and Innovation, will be speaking during the seminar titled, &ldquo;The Emerging Edge and Role of Optical Infrastructure&rdquo; on Thursday, August 25 at 9:15 a.m. MDT. Broadband operators will learn about the drivers, benefits and the expected growth of Edge Compute and Data Centers. They will also gain an understanding on the impacts and implications of Edge Compute on the optical passive infrastructure in broadband networks. </span></span><a href="https://www.iseexpo.com/2022/registration"><span style="background: white; color: #00b0f0;">Register here</span></a><span style="background: white; color: black;">.</span></p>

        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="background: white; color: black;">AFL&rsquo;s Converged Access Network</span><span style="background: white; color: #00b0f0;"> </span><span style="background: white; color: black;">meets the demands of the present and the future through three key characteristics: Expandability, Flexibility and Accessibility. This solution can help build a network in a range of application areas including 5G/Wireless Fronthaul/Backhaul, Fiber-to-the-Home/-Business, Multiple Dwelling Unit/Multiple Tenant Units, Campuses and Venues, Enterprise and Small Cell. </span></p>
        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="background: white; color: black;">AFL will feature Apex Sealed Splice Closures</span><span style="background: white; color: #00b0f0;"> </span><span style="background: white; color: black;">at ISE EXPO. These closures are designed to lower overall installation time with easier-to-use sealing and cable retention methods. With a wedge-based gel sealing system, installation time is drastically decreased. The Apex X-2 and X-2S splice closure sizes have maximum capacities of 3,456 and 1,728 fibers, respectively, when using 200 &micro;m SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg;. </span></p>
        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span style="background: white; color: black;">AFL&rsquo;s NodeFLEX Cable Assemblies, which are used to link the Optical Distribution Network to Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial Nodes, will be on display. AFL's NodeFLEX cable assemblies utilize a bendable boot with integrated steel wires, allowing a single product to cover both aerial and below-grade or pedestal applications. This flexible boot allows installers to flex the boot to an angle up to 90&deg; and hold that position for applications where 90&deg; entry is required. This eliminates the need for separate straight and 90&deg; node cables, thus reducing inventory and ordering complexity. </span></p>
        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span>Visit booth #232 to see demonstrations of the Fujikura 90S+ with Active Fusion Control (AFC) technology. AFC technology improves splice losses for fibers that possess a poor cleave angle and prevents bad splices due to a poorly maintained cleaver. With the extended life of 300 splice and heat cycles, the 90S+ fusion splicer can be used in multiple field splicing applications such as bend-insensitive fibers in drop cables, long-haul terrestrial and submarine LEAF&reg; fibers, loose buffer fiber, splice-on connectors and more. </span></p>
        <p>AFL&rsquo;s FlexScan TS100 Optical Troubleshooter and VFI4 will also be showcased. The TS100 is an easy-to-use, all-in-one tool for detecting, identifying, locating and resolving single-mode optical network issues. Designed primarily for field technicians activating and maintaining broadband access networks, the TS100 requires minimal training and no OTDR experience, allowing even novice technicians to perform a single-ended test in under three seconds. </p>
        <p><span>Enabling technicians to quickly spot faults, AFL's VFI4 injects a high-powered red laser light that provides exceptional brightness and range for locating defects in single-mode and multimode fibers. This essential tool is used to identify and trace fibers during activation and installation, identify poorly mated connectors, verify AFL&rsquo;s FASTConnect&reg; field-installable connector installation and find faults inside OTDR dead zones.</span></p>
        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span>Lastly, <span style="background: white; color: black;">Se&aacute;n Adam, AFL Vice President of Market Strategy and Innovation, will be speaking during the seminar titled, &ldquo;The Emerging Edge and Role of Optical Infrastructure&rdquo; on Thursday, August 25 at 9:15 a.m. MDT. Broadband operators will learn about the drivers, benefits and the expected growth of Edge Compute and Data Centers. They will also gain an understanding on the impacts and implications of Edge Compute on the optical passive infrastructure in broadband networks. </span></span><a href="https://www.iseexpo.com/2022/registration"><span style="background: white; color: #00b0f0;">Register here</span></a><span style="background: white; color: black;">.</span></p>
