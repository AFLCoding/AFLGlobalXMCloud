        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a> is launching a high-efficiency Dissipator Stockbridge vibration damper, a <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Motion-Control-Accessories.aspx">motion control</a> attachment that provides significant performance improvement over traditional dampers. The new Stockbridge vibration damper features a unique offset bell-shaped weight configuration that doubles the number of resonant frequencies. This provides more consistent efficiency performance over the Aeolian frequency span and eliminates damage caused by Aeolian vibration.<br />
        <br />
        “With the combined proven performance of two different sized weights and uneven messenger lengths, optimum performance is achieved,” stated Gary Harter, commercial manager for AFL’s conductor accessories division. “Damage is reduced and the life of transmission lines is extended, ultimately reducing costs for our customers.”<br />
        <br />
        With four natural frequency response modes coupled with its unique weight shape, AFL’s high-efficiency Dissipator Stockbridge vibration damper provides one of the widest frequency ranges in the industry. The damper’s offset bell-shaped weights provide corona performance up to 500 kV. The conductor clamp can be used on HiTemp® conductor applications up to 250°C without the need for armor rods. Optional break-a-way bolts are available to ensure consistent torque requirements.<br />
        <br />
        To help customers determine the number of Stockbridge vibration dampers or <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Motion-Control-Accessories/Spacers/Speed-Grip-Spacers-for-Two-Bundle-Conductors-33.aspx">Speed-Grip Spacers</a> required for each span as well as location suggestions, AFL offers <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Software/Vibrec/Vibrec.aspx">Vibrec™</a>, an integrated Windows®-based vibration analysis program at no cost. Vibrec is available for download on <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Software/Vibrec/Vibrec.aspx">AFL’s</a> website.<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a> is launching a high-efficiency Dissipator Stockbridge vibration damper, a <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Motion-Control-Accessories.aspx">motion control</a> attachment that provides significant performance improvement over traditional dampers. The new Stockbridge vibration damper features a unique offset bell-shaped weight configuration that doubles the number of resonant frequencies. This provides more consistent efficiency performance over the Aeolian frequency span and eliminates damage caused by Aeolian vibration.<br />
        <br />
        “With the combined proven performance of two different sized weights and uneven messenger lengths, optimum performance is achieved,” stated Gary Harter, commercial manager for AFL’s conductor accessories division. “Damage is reduced and the life of transmission lines is extended, ultimately reducing costs for our customers.”<br />
        <br />
        With four natural frequency response modes coupled with its unique weight shape, AFL’s high-efficiency Dissipator Stockbridge vibration damper provides one of the widest frequency ranges in the industry. The damper’s offset bell-shaped weights provide corona performance up to 500 kV. The conductor clamp can be used on HiTemp® conductor applications up to 250°C without the need for armor rods. Optional break-a-way bolts are available to ensure consistent torque requirements.<br />
        <br />
        To help customers determine the number of Stockbridge vibration dampers or <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Motion-Control-Accessories/Spacers/Speed-Grip-Spacers-for-Two-Bundle-Conductors-33.aspx">Speed-Grip Spacers</a> required for each span as well as location suggestions, AFL offers <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Software/Vibrec/Vibrec.aspx">Vibrec™</a>, an integrated Windows®-based vibration analysis program at no cost. Vibrec is available for download on <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Software/Vibrec/Vibrec.aspx">AFL’s</a> website.<br />
