        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of cable, connectivity and equipment, announces that four of its products were recognized among the best in the industry by the 2021 Broadband Technology Report's Diamond Technology Reviews. AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BD16F0851A334911A1C25E3194A9D166&amp;_z=z">Apex&reg; splice closure</a>,&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AB973208EAD1411A8148C998A95E324E&amp;_z=z">FlexScan&reg; FTTH PON Troubleshooter</a>&nbsp;along with the FlowScout PON Optical Power Meter and Port Saver OTDR Connectors, received honoree scores.<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;While the FTTx market sees remarkable growth, we continue developing advanced technology that enhances fiber optic networks while driving effective results,&rdquo; explained Kurt Dallas, President of AFL&rsquo;s Product Solutions. &ldquo;These awards are a testament to how our research and development teams collaborate to provide innovative solutions that support the changing landscape.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        AFL received Honoree Scores of 4.0 for its&nbsp;Apex splice closure&nbsp;and&nbsp;FlexScan TS100 FTTH PON Troubleshooter. The Apex splice closure is designed to lower overall installation time with easier-to-use sealing and cable retention methods. With a wedge-based gel sealing system, installation time is drastically decreased as network reliability increases. The FlexScan TS100 Troubleshooter is an easy-to-use, all-in-one tool for detecting, identifying, locating, and resolving single-mode optical network issues. With auto-configured settings, the TS100 quickly measures received power, link length, loss, and ORL with the push of a button.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        AFL received Honoree Scores for its FlowScout PON Optical Power Meter and Field-replaceable Port Saver OTDR connectors. The FlowScout PON power meter can be used on PON networks such as BPON, EPON, GPON, 10G-EPON, XG-PON, XGS-PON, and video/RFoG for network activation, testing and troubleshooting. AFL&rsquo;s Port Saver field-replaceable connectors fit all FlexScan OTDRs (FS200, FS300, TS100) and can be easily replaced in the field if damaged, eliminating expensive and time-consuming factory repair. Until now, OTDR connectors damaged due to even a single mating to a dirty or damaged connector required factory repair to replace the damaged ferrule.<br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of cable, connectivity and equipment, announces that four of its products were recognized among the best in the industry by the 2021 Broadband Technology Report's Diamond Technology Reviews. AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BD16F0851A334911A1C25E3194A9D166&amp;_z=z">Apex&reg; splice closure</a>,&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AB973208EAD1411A8148C998A95E324E&amp;_z=z">FlexScan&reg; FTTH PON Troubleshooter</a>&nbsp;along with the FlowScout PON Optical Power Meter and Port Saver OTDR Connectors, received honoree scores.<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;While the FTTx market sees remarkable growth, we continue developing advanced technology that enhances fiber optic networks while driving effective results,&rdquo; explained Kurt Dallas, President of AFL&rsquo;s Product Solutions. &ldquo;These awards are a testament to how our research and development teams collaborate to provide innovative solutions that support the changing landscape.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        AFL received Honoree Scores of 4.0 for its&nbsp;Apex splice closure&nbsp;and&nbsp;FlexScan TS100 FTTH PON Troubleshooter. The Apex splice closure is designed to lower overall installation time with easier-to-use sealing and cable retention methods. With a wedge-based gel sealing system, installation time is drastically decreased as network reliability increases. The FlexScan TS100 Troubleshooter is an easy-to-use, all-in-one tool for detecting, identifying, locating, and resolving single-mode optical network issues. With auto-configured settings, the TS100 quickly measures received power, link length, loss, and ORL with the push of a button.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        AFL received Honoree Scores for its FlowScout PON Optical Power Meter and Field-replaceable Port Saver OTDR connectors. The FlowScout PON power meter can be used on PON networks such as BPON, EPON, GPON, 10G-EPON, XG-PON, XGS-PON, and video/RFoG for network activation, testing and troubleshooting. AFL&rsquo;s Port Saver field-replaceable connectors fit all FlexScan OTDRs (FS200, FS300, TS100) and can be easily replaced in the field if damaged, eliminating expensive and time-consuming factory repair. Until now, OTDR connectors damaged due to even a single mating to a dirty or damaged connector required factory repair to replace the damaged ferrule.<br />
