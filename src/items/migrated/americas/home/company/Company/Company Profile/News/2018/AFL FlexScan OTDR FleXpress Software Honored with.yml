        <p>Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic system solutions, was honored with a 4.0 Diamonds award from the Diamond Technology Reviews for its <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A1055BC9C33B40258E0F1C3DAC9D2B44&_z=z">FleXpress Fast OTDR Test Mode for FlexScan OTDRs</a>. The Diamond Technology Reviews by <a href="https://www.broadbandtechreport.com/index.html">Broadband Technology Report</a> recognizes innovation in technology and is judged by a panel of executives from various operators.</p>
        <p>“AFL is honored to once again be recognized for innovation which truly benefits our OTDR customers,” stated Michael Scholten, senior product marketing manager for AFL. “FleXpress enables dramatic reduction in OTDR test time, significantly reducing operating expenses associated with verifying new fiber installations.”</p>
        <div>
        FlexScan is a pocket-sized, hand-held <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6C4448CCBB984BF6A7C950F996D2B39D&_z=z">OTDR</a> which provides fast, accurate fiber optic network characterization and fault location. Combining SmartAuto® data acquisition with event analysis and intuitive LinkMap® display, FlexScan enables technicians to quickly and easily troubleshoot faulty optical networks, or completely characterize newly installed networks. AFL’s award-winning FlexScan with FleXpress fast test software provides the fastest single or multi-fiber OTDR test in the industry.<br />
        <br />
        Scholten continued, “Coupled with FlexScan's pocket-sized form factor, light weight, rugged package and technician-friendly ease-of-use, the FlexScan with FleXpress is arguably the most cost-effective fiber optic installation verification and troubleshooting test tool in the market today.”<br />
        <br />
