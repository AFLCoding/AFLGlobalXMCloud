        <p>Kent, WA and Spartanburg, SC – Light Brigade, AFL’s training and education division, introduces its newest class to their extensive line-up of instructor-led training. The four-day <em>Advanced OSP Technician</em> course offers a true “next step” in training for those who have previous experience with fiber optics.</p>
        <div>
        The program offers a quick review of basic fiber terminology and technology before diving into topics like FTTx, xWDM systems and outside plant skills like emergency restoration and fiber characterization. In addition, students will learn how collapsible ribbon, 200 micron fiber, “micro” style cables and other trends may affect them in the field. Participants spend the majority of class time in hands-on skills labs where they learn to perfect their cable prep, splicing and testing skills by building a fiber link from patch panel to patch panel through various closures.<br />
         <br />
        “Our goal was to address a request from many customers looking for an advanced course that took a deep dive into today’s outside plant skills,” explained Andy Daigle, learning and development manager for Light Brigade. “Along with preparing students for a certification exam, we wanted to give our thousands of Fiber Optics 1-2-3 graduates a great follow-on class to extend their skills and provide the perfect next step in their professional development.”<br />
         <br />
        Designed to advance any fiber technician’s installation skills and industry knowledge, <em>Advanced OSP Technician</em> also prepares students for the ETA’s Fiber Optics Technician – Outside Plant (FOT-OSP) certification exam. This course requires that students have knowledge of fiber optic theory, terminology and field experience, or formal training such as Fiber Optics 1-2-3 or an equivalent.<br />
        <br />
        <em>Advanced OSP Technician</em> will be available in December 2018 and offered in more than a dozen cities in 2019.<br />

        <p>Kent, WA and Spartanburg, SC – Light Brigade, AFL’s training and education division, introduces its newest class to their extensive line-up of instructor-led training. The four-day <em>Advanced OSP Technician</em> course offers a true “next step” in training for those who have previous experience with fiber optics.</p>
        <div>
        The program offers a quick review of basic fiber terminology and technology before diving into topics like FTTx, xWDM systems and outside plant skills like emergency restoration and fiber characterization. In addition, students will learn how collapsible ribbon, 200 micron fiber, “micro” style cables and other trends may affect them in the field. Participants spend the majority of class time in hands-on skills labs where they learn to perfect their cable prep, splicing and testing skills by building a fiber link from patch panel to patch panel through various closures.<br />
         <br />
        “Our goal was to address a request from many customers looking for an advanced course that took a deep dive into today’s outside plant skills,” explained Andy Daigle, learning and development manager for Light Brigade. “Along with preparing students for a certification exam, we wanted to give our thousands of Fiber Optics 1-2-3 graduates a great follow-on class to extend their skills and provide the perfect next step in their professional development.”<br />
         <br />
        Designed to advance any fiber technician’s installation skills and industry knowledge, <em>Advanced OSP Technician</em> also prepares students for the ETA’s Fiber Optics Technician – Outside Plant (FOT-OSP) certification exam. This course requires that students have knowledge of fiber optic theory, terminology and field experience, or formal training such as Fiber Optics 1-2-3 or an equivalent.<br />
        <br />
        <em>Advanced OSP Technician</em> will be available in December 2018 and offered in more than a dozen cities in 2019.<br />
