        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /">AFL</a> is launching two <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Cleavers/CT-101-and-CT-102-Fiber-Cleavers ">Fujikura new tension cleavers</a> designed for fibers with a cladding diameter of 80 to 250 µm. Developed for adjustability for diverse applications, the CT-101 and CT-102 fiber cleavers offer superior tension cleaving performance beyond most other conventional cleavers.</p>
        <p>“As splicing fibers becomes more specialized and fiber types become more diversified, versatility is needed,” commented Brad Hendrix, global specialty market manager for AFL. “Fujikura’s new CT-101 and CT-102 cleavers offer versatility coupled with exceptional quality to attain very low cleave angles over the entire fiber diameter range specified. These cleavers also have the ability to produce repeatable angled cleaves when required.”</p>
        <p>Both cleavers are equipped with a new motorized diamond blade assembly. The tension is easily adjusted to meet the precise requirements for all fiber diameters in this range. Additional features include angled cleaving (0 to 15°), cleave counter, adjustable cleave length (3 mm to 40 mm) and dual power sources (batteries or an AC adapter).</p>
        <p>Fujikura is well-known around the world for providing the industry standard in fusion splicers and AFL is the exclusive provider of these products in North America. AFL offers an extensive lineup of fusion splicers for specialty splicing applications.</p>

        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /">AFL</a> is launching two <a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Cleavers/CT-101-and-CT-102-Fiber-Cleavers ">Fujikura new tension cleavers</a> designed for fibers with a cladding diameter of 80 to 250 µm. Developed for adjustability for diverse applications, the CT-101 and CT-102 fiber cleavers offer superior tension cleaving performance beyond most other conventional cleavers.</p>
        <p>“As splicing fibers becomes more specialized and fiber types become more diversified, versatility is needed,” commented Brad Hendrix, global specialty market manager for AFL. “Fujikura’s new CT-101 and CT-102 cleavers offer versatility coupled with exceptional quality to attain very low cleave angles over the entire fiber diameter range specified. These cleavers also have the ability to produce repeatable angled cleaves when required.”</p>
        <p>Both cleavers are equipped with a new motorized diamond blade assembly. The tension is easily adjusted to meet the precise requirements for all fiber diameters in this range. Additional features include angled cleaving (0 to 15°), cleave counter, adjustable cleave length (3 mm to 40 mm) and dual power sources (batteries or an AC adapter).</p>
        <p>Fujikura is well-known around the world for providing the industry standard in fusion splicers and AFL is the exclusive provider of these products in North America. AFL offers an extensive lineup of fusion splicers for specialty splicing applications.</p>
