        AFL, a leading provider of fiber optic solutions, is expanding its presence in Brasil. AFL’s effort is largely in response to the rapid growth in Fiber to the Home (FTTH) applications in the country. As part of the support strategy for the region, Tony Medeiros has been appointed as New Technology Consultant and Brasil Representative for AFL. Medeiros’ Head Office is in São Paulo, and he will have the responsibility to represent AFL throughout the country.<br />
        <br />
        Medeiros brings more than 25 years of hands-on fiber optics experience to the role. His specialties include test, turnup, installation and design of optical networks. Medeiros also served as a consultant to the Department of Defense and U.S. Army 571st Signal Brigade for KOTNET operations in South Korea. Medeiros holds a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University in Rio de Janeiro with postgraduate studies at the University of Connecticut at Storrs.<br />
        <br />
        “In South America, Brasil is truly setting the pace in FTTH deployment. AFL is pleased to be a part of this growth and bring our expertise to new customers in the region,” commented Steve Althoff, EVP and general manager. “Tony has a proven record of using his technical acumen to make a difference in complex projects.”<br />
        <br />
        As part of launching our new presence in the region, AFL is hosting complimentary FTTH Fiber Optic Technology Seminars which are inclusive of utilizing both presentation and hands-on formats. Topics include the following:<br />
        <br />
        FTTH network topologies<br />
        Latest technologies in testing FTTH networks and systems<br />
        Overview of how FTTH is being implemented in the USA<br />
        Preview of CFHP (Certified Fiber to the Home Planner) prerequisite material<br />
        The first seminar was held earlier today in São Paulo. AFL will host a second seminar in Rio de Janeiro at 9 a.m. on 16 August 2012 at the Sheraton Rio. To sign up to attend the seminar in Rio de Janeiro, sign up here. <br />
