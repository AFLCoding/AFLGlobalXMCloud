        <p>Spartanburg, S.C. – <a href=" /">AFL</a> presented nearly $14K in grants to three nonprofit organizations in the Spartanburg community. Made possible by AFL’s <a href=" /Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a>, the grants support AFL’s continued efforts to positively impact our communities.<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="http://www.spartanburgymca.org/middle-tyger-ymca.php">Middle Tyger YMCA</a> is the recipient of an $8,000 grant to support Partners with Youth, a program that supports participants with financial assistance toward membership fees and programs offered by the YMCA, including after-school care, summer camps, youth sports and more.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://bethematch.org/Home ">Be the Match Foundation</a> received a $3,000 grant to support efforts in the Spartanburg community to recruit registrants into the Be the Match program. The Foundation supports the life-saving mission of the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) and works to ensure that patients diagnosed with blood cancers and other diseases get the marrow or cord blood transplant needed.<br />
        <br />
        Finally, the <a href="http://www.hopecfc.org/">Hope Center for Children</a> received a $2,800 grant for its VISTA program. The VISTA will provide marketing support to the Hope Center, an organization committed to meeting a range of child and family needs in order to break the cycle of child abuse and neglect, and build stable, healthy families.<br />
        <br />
        “These organizations are instrumental to the health of our community,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Supporting their endeavors to make a difference in the lives of men, women, children and families defines AFL’s Program.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Community Outreach Program was created in response to the growing need for support in our communities and the desire to make a difference. The program consists of grants, employee engagement projects, tree planting initiatives and more.<br />

        <p>Spartanburg, S.C. – <a href=" /">AFL</a> presented nearly $14K in grants to three nonprofit organizations in the Spartanburg community. Made possible by AFL’s <a href=" /Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a>, the grants support AFL’s continued efforts to positively impact our communities.<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="http://www.spartanburgymca.org/middle-tyger-ymca.php">Middle Tyger YMCA</a> is the recipient of an $8,000 grant to support Partners with Youth, a program that supports participants with financial assistance toward membership fees and programs offered by the YMCA, including after-school care, summer camps, youth sports and more.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://bethematch.org/Home ">Be the Match Foundation</a> received a $3,000 grant to support efforts in the Spartanburg community to recruit registrants into the Be the Match program. The Foundation supports the life-saving mission of the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) and works to ensure that patients diagnosed with blood cancers and other diseases get the marrow or cord blood transplant needed.<br />
        <br />
        Finally, the <a href="http://www.hopecfc.org/">Hope Center for Children</a> received a $2,800 grant for its VISTA program. The VISTA will provide marketing support to the Hope Center, an organization committed to meeting a range of child and family needs in order to break the cycle of child abuse and neglect, and build stable, healthy families.<br />
        <br />
        “These organizations are instrumental to the health of our community,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Supporting their endeavors to make a difference in the lives of men, women, children and families defines AFL’s Program.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Community Outreach Program was created in response to the growing need for support in our communities and the desire to make a difference. The program consists of grants, employee engagement projects, tree planting initiatives and more.<br />
