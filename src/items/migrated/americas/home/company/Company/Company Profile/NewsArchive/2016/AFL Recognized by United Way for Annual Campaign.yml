        Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /Home ">AFL</a>, a leading global fiber optic cable and accessories manufacturer, was recognized by <a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a> for its annual <a href=" /Company/Community/United-Way ">corporate campaign</a>. AFL was the recipient of three awards including a top award for Outstanding Employee Giving ($150K - $200K), having set a personal record during the campaign with a 13 percent increase in donors and a 16 percent increase in the number of employee donations over 2015. Additionally, AFL received the Outstanding Campaign Committee Award, for demonstrating exceptional teamwork resulting in increased associate per capita giving, and the Outstanding Creativity Award, for having a creative and innovative campaign theme.<br />
        <br />
        The campaign theme stemmed from the Star Wars saga, using the tagline, “Make a Difference, You Can.” The annual two-week United Way campaign launched with informational meetings that provided an opportunity for every AFL associate to learn more about United Way’s impact in the local community. Agency representatives attended various meetings and spoke with associates about their organization and United Way’s impact on them.<br />
        <br />
        “<a href=" /Company/Community ">Community outreach</a> is part of our DNA and we believe United Way is the perfect vehicle for AFL to understand and meet the local need,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “It is a great honor to be recognized by United Way of the Piedmont for the impact we have on our community through this campaign.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL associates in Spartanburg presented $208K to United Way of the Piedmont. AFL’s <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection ">Test & Inspection</a> division and the <a href=" /Services/Training/The-Light-Brigade ">Light Brigade®</a> also participated in this year’s campaign. The Test & Inspection division donated $9,000, a 5 percent increase over the previous year and The Light Brigade donated $5,000, a 25 percent increase from the previous year. In total, AFL donated $222,000 to United Way in four states.<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /Home ">AFL</a>, a leading global fiber optic cable and accessories manufacturer, was recognized by <a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a> for its annual <a href=" /Company/Community/United-Way ">corporate campaign</a>. AFL was the recipient of three awards including a top award for Outstanding Employee Giving ($150K - $200K), having set a personal record during the campaign with a 13 percent increase in donors and a 16 percent increase in the number of employee donations over 2015. Additionally, AFL received the Outstanding Campaign Committee Award, for demonstrating exceptional teamwork resulting in increased associate per capita giving, and the Outstanding Creativity Award, for having a creative and innovative campaign theme.<br />
        <br />
        The campaign theme stemmed from the Star Wars saga, using the tagline, “Make a Difference, You Can.” The annual two-week United Way campaign launched with informational meetings that provided an opportunity for every AFL associate to learn more about United Way’s impact in the local community. Agency representatives attended various meetings and spoke with associates about their organization and United Way’s impact on them.<br />
        <br />
        “<a href=" /Company/Community ">Community outreach</a> is part of our DNA and we believe United Way is the perfect vehicle for AFL to understand and meet the local need,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “It is a great honor to be recognized by United Way of the Piedmont for the impact we have on our community through this campaign.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL associates in Spartanburg presented $208K to United Way of the Piedmont. AFL’s <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection ">Test & Inspection</a> division and the <a href=" /Services/Training/The-Light-Brigade ">Light Brigade®</a> also participated in this year’s campaign. The Test & Inspection division donated $9,000, a 5 percent increase over the previous year and The Light Brigade donated $5,000, a 25 percent increase from the previous year. In total, AFL donated $222,000 to United Way in four states.<br />
