        Spartanburg, SC - AFL, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable and components, announces its plans to release multiple new products at OFC/NFOEC 2008 in late February. New products include splicer accessories, test equipment, closures and connectors.<br />
        <br />
        To complement Fujikura’s advanced, high precision splicing products, AFL has added the NYFORS™ product line to its existing suite and will be demonstrating these products in Booth #1119 . New products include the AutoCleaver, AutoCleaver S1, S2 and AutoCleaverLDF, CleaveMasterLDF and CleaveMeterLDF; MiniCoater, Recoater 1 and AutoCoater; and the ProofTester. NYFORS, a manufacturer of state-of-the-art products used in the production of optical components and systems, has been delivering innovative, high quality products since 1987. Core technologies include fiber optic recoating, cleaving, analyzing, testing and fiber preparation.<br />
        <br />
        Featuring just four components, AFL's FuseConnect fusion-splice field-terminated connector is uniquely designed and easy to use. With a factory pre-terminated end-face, its innovative field termination process eliminates the need for polishing, adhesives and crimping in the field. FuseConnect utilizes a fusion splicer to terminate the connector yielding true APC performance, and ultimately addressing return loss concerns present in analog optical networks. Designed to work with a 10mm cleave length and with splicers that utilize a fiber holder system, FuseConnect is compatible not only with Fujikura’s family of fusion splicers, but also with other industry-available fiber holder-based fusion splicing platforms. Demonstrations will be provided onsite.<br />
        <br />
        Designed for aerial and underground drop access applications, the LG-350-AC Sealed Fiber Optic Closure is ideal when a sealed closure is required, but where space is limited. Over 25% smaller than the field-proven LG-350, the new closure is ideal for small hand-hole applications (such as Fiber-to-the-Home). The LG-350-AC provides access for up to 12 drops and up to 72 single fused splices in a butt splice configuration. Supporting standard loose tube, outside plant ribbon and Uniflex® fiber optic cables in both dielectric and armored configurations, installation and re-entry is easy and only requires common hand tools. Stop by booth #3438 to see this new closure.<br />
        <br />
        Lastly, AFL will debut the new Noyes M700 Single-Mode OTDR with Visual Fault Locator and Optical Power Meter. A compact, full-featured OTDR, the M700 includes a large transflective touch screen display suitable for both indoor and outdoor operation. Thousands of OTDR and OPM results can be stored internally or on a USB drive, and are transferable via a USB cable or drive to a computer for viewing, printing and analyzing with Windows® compatible software. With short dead zones, a dynamic range of 38dB, and greater than 8-hour battery life during continuous testing, the M700 is perfect for testing optical fibers in service provider metro areas. Demonstrations of this new product can be seen in Booth #1119 and in the OSP pavilion, Booth #3438.<br />
        <br />
        AFL continues to provide leading-edge, technology-driven products to satisfy the demands of various markets within the telecommunications industry. For additional information on AFL and these new products, visit www.AFLglobal.com.<br />

        Spartanburg, SC - AFL, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable and components, announces its plans to release multiple new products at OFC/NFOEC 2008 in late February. New products include splicer accessories, test equipment, closures and connectors.<br />
        <br />
        To complement Fujikura’s advanced, high precision splicing products, AFL has added the NYFORS™ product line to its existing suite and will be demonstrating these products in Booth #1119 . New products include the AutoCleaver, AutoCleaver S1, S2 and AutoCleaverLDF, CleaveMasterLDF and CleaveMeterLDF; MiniCoater, Recoater 1 and AutoCoater; and the ProofTester. NYFORS, a manufacturer of state-of-the-art products used in the production of optical components and systems, has been delivering innovative, high quality products since 1987. Core technologies include fiber optic recoating, cleaving, analyzing, testing and fiber preparation.<br />
        <br />
        Featuring just four components, AFL's FuseConnect fusion-splice field-terminated connector is uniquely designed and easy to use. With a factory pre-terminated end-face, its innovative field termination process eliminates the need for polishing, adhesives and crimping in the field. FuseConnect utilizes a fusion splicer to terminate the connector yielding true APC performance, and ultimately addressing return loss concerns present in analog optical networks. Designed to work with a 10mm cleave length and with splicers that utilize a fiber holder system, FuseConnect is compatible not only with Fujikura’s family of fusion splicers, but also with other industry-available fiber holder-based fusion splicing platforms. Demonstrations will be provided onsite.<br />
        <br />
        Designed for aerial and underground drop access applications, the LG-350-AC Sealed Fiber Optic Closure is ideal when a sealed closure is required, but where space is limited. Over 25% smaller than the field-proven LG-350, the new closure is ideal for small hand-hole applications (such as Fiber-to-the-Home). The LG-350-AC provides access for up to 12 drops and up to 72 single fused splices in a butt splice configuration. Supporting standard loose tube, outside plant ribbon and Uniflex® fiber optic cables in both dielectric and armored configurations, installation and re-entry is easy and only requires common hand tools. Stop by booth #3438 to see this new closure.<br />
        <br />
        Lastly, AFL will debut the new Noyes M700 Single-Mode OTDR with Visual Fault Locator and Optical Power Meter. A compact, full-featured OTDR, the M700 includes a large transflective touch screen display suitable for both indoor and outdoor operation. Thousands of OTDR and OPM results can be stored internally or on a USB drive, and are transferable via a USB cable or drive to a computer for viewing, printing and analyzing with Windows® compatible software. With short dead zones, a dynamic range of 38dB, and greater than 8-hour battery life during continuous testing, the M700 is perfect for testing optical fibers in service provider metro areas. Demonstrations of this new product can be seen in Booth #1119 and in the OSP pavilion, Booth #3438.<br />
