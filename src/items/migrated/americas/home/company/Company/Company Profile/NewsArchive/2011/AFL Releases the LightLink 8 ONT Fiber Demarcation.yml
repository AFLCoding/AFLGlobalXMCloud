        <p>Spartanburg, SC<br />
        AFL introduces the LightLink (LL) 3008 8/ONT cabinet, designed to provide secure and convenient location for optical network terminals (ONTs). The cabinet allows a technician to easily access a subscriber's ONT for testing, performance monitoring and fault isolation.</p>
        <p>The LL-3008 houses eight ONTs and the optional skirt houses up to four battery back-up units (BBUs). Constructed with weather-tight gasketing, the cabinet is rated NEMA 3 for indoor/outdoor pad- or wall-mounted applications. A removable plate in the bottom of the cabinet allows for multiple conduit connections and uses LightLink grommets for passing OSP drop cables. Designed to allow for maximum heat dissipation, the LL-3008 keeps its cool in the most extreme environments.</p>
        <p>Additional features of the LL-3008 cabinet include a prop rod with door opening and an interchangeable door opening to either the right or left side with no additional parts required. For additional information on AFL's fiber demarcation products, visit www.AFLglobal.com.</p>
