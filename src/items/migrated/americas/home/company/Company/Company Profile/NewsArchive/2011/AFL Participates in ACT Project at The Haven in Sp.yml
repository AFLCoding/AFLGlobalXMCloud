        <p>On November 5, 57 AFL associates together with family and friends, volunteered for a day of service at The Haven, a shelter for homeless families in Spartanburg. The volunteers participated in variety of improvement projects at the property, all aimed to improve the living environment for The Haven’s residents.</p>
        <p>This AFL ACT (AFL Community Team) project was organized and conducted by AFL’s Conductor Accessories group and a total of 70 associates and family members donated their time to this project. AFL volunteers cleaned and organized the facility’s storage room, cleaned several bathrooms and installed lighting, blinds, cabinets and shelving. The group also worked on the grounds raking and clearing branches and vines from the house and gutters.</p>
        <p>“AFL has a long tradition of giving back to our communities,” said Steve Ferguson, General Manager of AFL’s Conductor Accessories group. “I am personally honored to be working with a group that cares about making Spartanburg a better place to live and wants to help those who need assistance.”</p>
        <p>AFL encourages its associates to engage with local non-profit organizations by participating in ACT projects. The goal is for AFL volunteers to come together to provide “sweat equity” for a non-profit and make a significant impact in a short period of time.</p>
        <p>In addition to working on the property, AFL associates donated new pillows, canned goods, undergarments, personal hygiene products and cleaning supplies, as well as over $ 625 in cash donations that was used to purchase additional needed items and 200 bus passes to be used by the families living at The Haven for transportation. AFL also presented The Haven with a grant check for $3,000 for their programs.</p>
        <p>The Haven provides shelter and services to homeless families and women in Spartanburg County. The group’s programs consist of The Shelter Program and Supportive Services Programs, including Intensive Case Management Services, Daily Living Skills and Extended Case Management.</p>

        <p>About The Haven:<br />
        The Haven was founded in 1983 as an outreach mission of Second Presbyterian Church. Originally it was meant to provide overnight shelter to transient men. In 1985, the service focus changed to sheltering homeless families in order to meet a growing and urgent need in the community. In 1986, The Haven became a tax-exempt nonprofit organization; however, Second Presbyterian Church remains a staunch supporter providing the shelter building, lawn care and monthly financial support for The Haven. The Haven is governed by a Board of Trustees that meets monthly.</p>
