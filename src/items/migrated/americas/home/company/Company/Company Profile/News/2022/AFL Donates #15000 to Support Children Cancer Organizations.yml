        <p>Spartanburg, SC | August 31, 2022 | <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">AFL</span></a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and accessories, donated a total of $15,000 in grants and sponsorships to <a href="https://childrenscancerpartners.org/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Children&rsquo;s Cancer Partners of the Carolinas (CCP)</span></a>, an organization that provides children, living in North or South Carolina, with funds for transportation, meals and lodging so they can receive the critical lifesaving treatments they need.</p>
        <p>AFL awarded a $10,000 grant to support CCP&rsquo;s Childhood Cancer Safety Net program. This program aims to ensure that every child living in the Carolinas who enters the program can receive all the necessary cancer treatments and resources that accompany treatment travel, regardless how often, far or long they must be treated. Made possible by AFL&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Company/Community"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Community Outreach Program</span></a>, funding will directly benefit and support children and their families on a micro/basic life needs level. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Due to the limited number of pediatric cancer treatment centers in the Carolinas (three in South Carolina and six in North Carolina), many children have to be treated at a cancer treatment center that requires travel and overnight stays,&rdquo; stated Dania Beck, Director of Philanthropy at <a href="https://childrenscancerpartners.org/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Children&rsquo;s Cancer Partners of the Carolinas</span></a>. &ldquo;Funds from AFL&rsquo;s grant will help with transportation costs, critical homecare needs, personal care needs, funeral/bereavement expenses and other counseling support.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>AFL also gave a total of $5,000 in sponsorships to support <a href="https://childrenscancerpartners.org/events/docs-who-rock/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Docs Who Rock Spartanburg</span></a><span style="color: #00b0f0;"> </span>and <a href="https://childrenscancerpartners.org/events/burger-cook-off/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Cribbs Kitchen Burger Cook-Off</span></a>, both of which benefit CCP. Docs Who Rock Spartanburg is a unique rock concert hosted by <a href="https://scmsalliance.org/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Spartanburg County Medical Society Alliance</span></a> where members of Spartanburg&rsquo;s medical community perform as band members and demonstrate their musical talents. Cribbs Kitchen Burger Cook-Off, presented by <a href="https://www.cribbskitchen.com/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Cribbs Kitchen</span></a>, is a cooking competition where burger enthusiasts display their cooking skills on the grill and compete to create their own custom burger.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We place great value on our partnerships with corporate and individual donors,&rdquo; continued Beck. &ldquo;With the help of generous donors, like AFL, CCP comes alongside families in need and offers critical support. CCP hosts events and activities that allow children and their families to connect with others who are fighting cancer, helping them to overcome their sense of isolation.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><a href="https://childrenscancerpartners.org/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Children&rsquo;s Cancer Partners of the Carolinas</span></a> mission is to provide comprehensive support and loving compassion to families whose children are battling cancer, to improve their overall quality of life. </p>

        <p>Spartanburg, SC – August 31, 2022 – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">AFL</span></a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and accessories, donated a total of $15,000 in grants and sponsorships to <a href="https://childrenscancerpartners.org/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Children’s Cancer Partners of the Carolinas (CCP)</span></a>, an organization that provides children, living in North or South Carolina, with funds for transportation, meals and lodging so they can receive the critical lifesaving treatments they need.</p>
        <p>AFL awarded a $10,000 grant to support CCP’s Childhood Cancer Safety Net program. This program aims to ensure that every child living in the Carolinas who enters the program can receive all the necessary cancer treatments and resources that accompany treatment travel, regardless how often, far or long they must be treated. Made possible by AFL’s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Company/Community"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Community Outreach Program</span></a>, funding will directly benefit and support children and their families on a micro/basic life needs level. </p>
        <p>“Due to the limited number of pediatric cancer treatment centers in the Carolinas (three in South Carolina and six in North Carolina), many children have to be treated at a cancer treatment center that requires travel and overnight stays,” stated Dania Beck, Director of Philanthropy at <a href="https://childrenscancerpartners.org/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Children’s Cancer Partners of the Carolinas</span></a>. “Funds from AFL’s grant will help with transportation costs, critical homecare needs, personal care needs, funeral/bereavement expenses and other counseling support.”</p>
        <p>AFL also gave a total of $5,000 in sponsorships to support <a href="https://childrenscancerpartners.org/events/docs-who-rock/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Docs Who Rock Spartanburg</span></a><span style="color: #00b0f0;"> </span>and <a href="https://childrenscancerpartners.org/events/burger-cook-off/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Cribbs Kitchen Burger Cook-Off</span></a>, both of which benefit CCP. Docs Who Rock Spartanburg is a unique rock concert hosted by <a href="https://scmsalliance.org/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Spartanburg County Medical Society Alliance</span></a> where members of Spartanburg’s medical community perform as band members and demonstrate their musical talents. Cribbs Kitchen Burger Cook-Off, presented by <a href="https://www.cribbskitchen.com/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Cribbs Kitchen</span></a>, is a cooking competition where burger enthusiasts display their cooking skills on the grill and compete to create their own custom burger.</p>
        <p>“We place great value on our partnerships with corporate and individual donors,” continued Beck. “With the help of generous donors, like AFL, CCP comes alongside families in need and offers critical support. CCP hosts events and activities that allow children and their families to connect with others who are fighting cancer, helping them to overcome their sense of isolation.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://childrenscancerpartners.org/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Children’s Cancer Partners of the Carolinas</span></a> mission is to provide comprehensive support and loving compassion to families whose children are battling cancer, to improve their overall quality of life. </p>
        <p> <span style="line-height: 106%;">AFL’s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Company/Community"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Community Outreach Program</span></a> includes grants, sponsorships, volunteer and environment initiatives, disaster relief, scholarships and more.
