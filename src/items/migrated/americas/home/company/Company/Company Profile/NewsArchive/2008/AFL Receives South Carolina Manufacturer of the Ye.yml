        Spartanburg, SC - On Tuesday, September 30, AFL was honored as it received the 2008 South Carolina Manufacturer of the Year Award for medium-sized manufacturers.  Hosted by the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, AFL received the award at the 14th annual South Carolina Manufacturers Appreciation Night in Columbia, SC.<br />
        <br />
        “It’s an honor to be recognized with so many great manufacturing companies in this State,” said Jody Gallagher, President and CEO of AFL, who received the award.  “We’ve worked hard to expand our operations in Spartanburg, not only with capital but with hiring and retaining outstanding employees. And at the end of the day, it’s our employees that make this happen and deserve to be recognized for this award.”<br />
        <br />
        Selection is based on responses to five criteria including: Quality Improvement of Product, Quality of Life Programs, Environmental Stewardship, Community and Professional, Development, Community Partnerships, and Overall Effectiveness.<br />
        <br />
        AFL will celebrate its 25th anniversary next year. Starting operations in 1984 as a fiber optic cable manufacturer with approximately 20 employees, AFL now employs over 500 in South Carolina and over 3,500 worldwide.<br />
        <br />
        “This helps reinforce that we are on the right course,” stated Gallagher. “Being a world-class supplier affirms our focus through the years on our commitment to employee safety, corporate social responsibility, and finding creative, productive ways to remain competitive in a global economy.”<br />
        <br />
        Today, AFL manufactures not only fiber optic cable, but also cable accessories, connectivity products, passive and active components, and outside plant equipment. In addition, AFL’s affiliate company, AFL, provides the engineering, installation and maintenance of networks within the Telco/Broadband, Electric Utility, and Wireless industries.<br />
        <br />
        AFL continues to expand operations with three acquisitions completed this year alone, and expects additional acquisitions by the end of their fiscal year.<br />
        <br />
        About AFL<br />
