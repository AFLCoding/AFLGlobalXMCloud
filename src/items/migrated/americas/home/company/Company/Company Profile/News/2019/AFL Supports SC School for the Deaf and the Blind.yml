Additionally, the multi-touch table will allow teachers to expand the technological education students need to succeed.<br />
        <br />
        Higdon continued, “Our objective in expanding Einstein’s Workshop is to continue to give students a solid foundation in important principles that will lead them into a STEM-focused area in high school and beyond.”<br />
        <br />
        Einstein’s Workshop is the only specialized school in South Carolina for children who are deaf, blind and sensory multi-disabled. The Workshop was established to expose students to new STEM concepts and give them the opportunity to explore them.   <br />
