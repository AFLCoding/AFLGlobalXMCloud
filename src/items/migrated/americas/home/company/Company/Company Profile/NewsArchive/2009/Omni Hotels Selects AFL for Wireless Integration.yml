        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;"><strong>Spartanburg, SC</strong> - AFL, an industry leader in hospitality technology integration and wireless engineering, announces they were selected for the wireless integration of the Omni Hotels commencing in 2009. The integration began with the Omni Fort Worth, the city's newest and largest hotel, which celebrated its grand opening January 12, 2009, followed by the Omni New Haven Hotel at Yale. BelAir Networks, a market leader in service provider WLAN, was selected for Wi-Fi deployments.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Omni Hotels was the first luxury hotel brand in the US to offer Wi-Fi system-wide with access in guest rooms and public spaces in 2003. Because Omni Hotels owns and manages the majority of their properties, technology support is centralized and standardized across the brand enabling rapid deployment and installation of new technology applications across the company. With a primary customer focus on upscale business and leisure travelers, Omni Hotels has experienced increased Internet use both in terms of the number of users as well as their bandwidth demands. This trend is driven by the growing number of Wi-Fi applications and mobile-enabled devices that guests use when they travel. The American Hotel & Lodging Association (AH&LA), in its study "2008 Current and Future Technology Use in the Hospitality Industry", identified Wi-Fi services as the "IT system that guests care about most." The importance of Wi-Fi to hotel guests in driving the hospitality industry's evolution to higher performance 802.11n based networks.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">"With nearly 50 percent of our guests using Wi-Fi and their bandwidth demands continuing to accelerate, we sought a high-performance network partner which could ensure we continue to serve our customers' needs on a 'go-forward basis'," said Richard Tudgay, vice president of information technology for Omni Hotels. "BelAir Networks comprehensive portfolio of indoor and outdoor Wi-Fi networking products enables us to deliver high-capacity, ubiquitous coverage that is cost-effective and easy for us to manage centrally."</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Installed and serviced by AFL, driven by the powerful, feature-rich BelAirOS operating system software, and managed by BelView, BelAir Networks offers the industry's most comprehensive product portfolio of indoor access points (AP) and outdoor wireless nodes supporting both Wi-Fi and WiMAX as well as public safety, defense and intelligent transportation system (ITS) frequency bands. At the Omni Fort Worth, AFL deployed 77 BelAir20 APs. These best-in-class, ultra-compact and easily powered dual-radio, dual-band 802.11n Wi-Fi indoor APs employ hosted software-based control enabling centralized management and lowering network CapEx by about 30%. Configurable as a wired AP, a mesh point or a bridge from outside, the BelAir20 AP supports both wireless and wired backhaul.</p>
