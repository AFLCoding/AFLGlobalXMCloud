        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories,&nbsp;was awarded six new patents over the past quarter for technology and developments in&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&amp;_z=z">connectivity</a>,&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=67697A36EE374C21A1F009672463F0E6&amp;_z=z">test and inspection</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E545E2A90D414F31BDD0BA9B8ED27FD0&amp;_z=z">fiber optic cable</a>.<br />
        <br />
        Three patents were received for connectivity. The first is for an invention that improves legacy assembly methods for furcation tubing assemblies in fanout kits by removing the need for adhesives. Adding color and a flared, larger insertion cone target enabled easier and faster installation of the furcation unit in the field. The second invention is for cable mount clips that snap onto panels and allow rotational freedom to relieve stress from twisted cables. The third patent was received for a fiber optic breakout assembly with inner tubes and strength filaments bonded together and connected to a housing for us in furcating optical fiber.<br />
        <br />
        Two patents were received in test and inspection. The Encircled Flux Compliant Test Apparatus patent is for a mode-insensitive coupler that provides a low-cost but high-precision fiber optic test interface for AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B307C1531CEE49B9BEDD0BD35F8B61BB&amp;_z=z">ROGUE&reg; OLTS/Certification test sets</a>. It can guarantee an encircled flux test light launching and mode-insensitive light power measurement. The Wireless Inspection Solution patent covers the invention allowing for the fiber inspection video stream and image analysis to be transmitted through a Wi-Fi network. While optical inspection is a key need for successful network deployments,&nbsp;AFL was first to market with a Wi-Fi-based inspection solution. AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1E352D911ADE4B188DDEBA3FD52F50F9&amp;_z=z">FOCIS WiFi2 Fiber Optic Connector Inspection System</a>&nbsp;uses this technology.<br />
        <br />
        Finally, AFL received a patent for a reduced diameter, high fiber density, double-jacketed central tube style MicroCore&reg; trunk cable. The product family is inclusive of both bare fiber and&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=740F36E4074A417CBAB68839104B5517&amp;_z=z">SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg; (SWR&reg;)</a>&nbsp;up to 144 fibers, and available in both plenum and LSZH applications.&nbsp;<br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, was awarded six new patents over the past quarter for technology and developments in <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&_z=z">connectivity</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=67697A36EE374C21A1F009672463F0E6&_z=z">test and inspection</a>, and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E545E2A90D414F31BDD0BA9B8ED27FD0&_z=z">fiber optic cable</a>.<br />
        <br />
        Three patents were received for connectivity. The first is for an invention that improves legacy assembly methods for furcation tubing assemblies in fanout kits by removing the need for adhesives. Adding color and a flared, larger insertion cone target enabled easier and faster installation of the furcation unit in the field. The second invention is for cable mount clips that snap onto panels and allow rotational freedom to relieve stress from twisted cables. The third patent was received for a fiber optic breakout assembly with inner tubes and strength filaments bonded together and connected to a housing for us in furcating optical fiber.<br />
        <br />
        Two patents were received in test and inspection. The Encircled Flux Compliant Test Apparatus patent is for a mode-insensitive coupler that provides a low-cost but high-precision fiber optic test interface for AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B307C1531CEE49B9BEDD0BD35F8B61BB&_z=z">ROGUE® OLTS/Certification test sets</a>. It can guarantee an encircled flux test light launching and mode-insensitive light power measurement. The Wireless Inspection Solution patent covers the invention allowing for the fiber inspection video stream and image analysis to be transmitted through a Wi-Fi network. While optical inspection is a key need for successful network deployments, AFL was first to market with a Wi-Fi-based inspection solution. AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1E352D911ADE4B188DDEBA3FD52F50F9&_z=z">FOCIS WiFi2 Fiber Optic Connector Inspection System</a> uses this technology.<br />
        <br />
        Finally, AFL received a patent for a reduced diameter, high fiber density, double-jacketed central tube style MicroCore® trunk cable. The product family is inclusive of both bare fiber and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=740F36E4074A417CBAB68839104B5517&_z=z">SpiderWeb Ribbon® (SWR®)</a> up to 144 fibers, and available in both plenum and LSZH applications. <br />
