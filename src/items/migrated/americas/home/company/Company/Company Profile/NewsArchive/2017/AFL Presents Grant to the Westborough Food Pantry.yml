        North Grafton, MA and Spartanburg, SC – April 3, 2017 – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> presented a grant to the <a href="http://westboroughfoodpantry.org/">Westborough Food Pantry</a>, an organization whose mission is to end hunger by providing residents in need access to nutritious and adequate amounts of food necessary for a healthy life. The $2,000 grant was made possible by <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">AFL’s Community Outreach Program</a> and will benefit the elderly population.<br />
        <br />
        “Many times the elderly do not have the ambition or knowledge to cook and prepare healthy meals,” commented Phil Kittredge, executive director for the Westborough Food Pantry. “With proper instruction and demonstration, we hope that some of their meals will become healthier. The grant from AFL will enable us to begin purchasing food to support this new program.”<br />
        <br />
        The Westborough Food Pantry’s nutritionist will develop low sodium meals that provide proper and balanced nutrition for the elderly and include alternative meats and vegetables for seniors. Additionally, a recipe file will be developed for home use.<br />
        <br />
        The Westborough Food Pantry provides food for over 130 Westborough families. Each family receives up to three bags of groceries depending on the size of the family. With 125-130 bags distributed per week and each bag weighing an estimated 15-20 pounds, the Food Pantry distributes more than 50 tons of food per year. The Food Pantry helps to feed an average of 900 people a month.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL supports programs that help individuals and families meet basic needs and build self-sufficiency,” explained Abdel Soufiane, general manager for AFL in North Grafton. “The Westborough Food Pantry has seen an unmet need in the community and is not only addressing it, but doing so in a healthier way. We are grateful for their commitment to the senior population.”<br />
        <br />

        “Many times the elderly do not have the ambition or knowledge to cook and prepare healthy meals,” commented Phil Kittredge, executive director for the Westborough Food Pantry. “With proper instruction and demonstration, we hope that some of their meals will become healthier. The grant from AFL will enable us to begin purchasing food to support this new program.”<br />
        <br />
        The Westborough Food Pantry’s nutritionist will develop low sodium meals that provide proper and balanced nutrition for the elderly and include alternative meats and vegetables for seniors. Additionally, a recipe file will be developed for home use.<br />
        <br />
        The Westborough Food Pantry provides food for over 130 Westborough families. Each family receives up to three bags of groceries depending on the size of the family. With 125-130 bags distributed per week and each bag weighing an estimated 15-20 pounds, the Food Pantry distributes more than 50 tons of food per year. The Food Pantry helps to feed an average of 900 people a month.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL supports programs that help individuals and families meet basic needs and build self-sufficiency,” explained Abdel Soufiane, general manager for AFL in North Grafton. “The Westborough Food Pantry has seen an unmet need in the community and is not only addressing it, but doing so in a healthier way. We are grateful for their commitment to the senior population.”<br />
