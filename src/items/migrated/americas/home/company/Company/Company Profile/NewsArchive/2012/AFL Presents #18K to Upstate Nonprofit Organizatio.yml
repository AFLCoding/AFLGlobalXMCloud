        Last week, AFL’s Community Advisory Board presented four grants to upstate nonprofit organizations in support of education, financial stability and health initiatives. The Middle Tyger YMCA, Habitat for Humanity® Spartanburg, the Ellen Hines Smith Girls’ Home and Mauldin Middle School were all recipients of an AFL grant.<br />
        <br />
        “We are grateful to be able to support our community by providing a financial gift during tough economic times,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “These grants reflect our wish to support initiatives that align with our greater community needs. We are confident the impact will be substantial for all recipients.”<br />
        <br />
        The Middle Tyger YMCA was the recipient of an $8,000 grant to support its Partners with Youth program. One hundred percent of these designated funds help families in the community that are not fortunate enough to be able to afford after-school care, swimming lessons or to play youth sports.<br />
        <br />
        Habitat for Humanity of Spartanburg was the recipient of a $5,000 grant to support the Wofford Street project where three homes are currently being built.<br />
        <br />
        The Ellen Hines Smith Girls’ Home (EHSGS) received a $3,884 grant to support an AmeriCorps VISTA. The new position, supported by United Way of the Piedmont, will provide capacity building efforts to enable EHSGS to grow its family services programs.<br />
        <br />
        And lastly, Mauldin Middle School’s Learning Disabled Self-Contained/Resource Neurological Disorder class was the recipient of a $2,000 grant for new tablets. These tablets can help improve socialization and fine motor skills through various applications that help students work on facial expressions, social, fine motor and academic skills.<br />
