        <p><a href=" /">Spartanburg, SC and Lowell, MA  –  AFL</a> enhances its <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Cleaning/FCP2-Field-Portable-Connector-Cleaning-Kits ">NOYES® FCP2 Field Portable Cleaning Kits</a> by adding inspection and loss testing capabilities including an inspection scope, power meter and light sources. The cleaning kits bundle several cleaning products into one convenient duffle bag style carry case to create a complete kit for field cleaning of connector end-faces.<br />
        <br />
        “Technicians need a kit with a variety of cleaning tools that can be easily carried in the field,” explains Kevin Haddock, product manager for AFL’s Test and Inspection division. “AFL responded to customer requests and expanded the kit options so customers can now order the basic cleaning kit, cleaning kit refills, basic kit with MPO/MTP option, or inspection and loss test kit options.”<br />
        <br />
        Contaminants such as dirt, dust and other particles from the environment can impede signals, cause costly network failures and increase downtime. AFL’s cleaning products effectively remove these contaminants and particles for consistent cleaning results every time saving users time and money. The kits now give users the ability to inspect and verify their work by adding the <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/OFS_300_Optical_Microscope ">OFS 300-200 Inspection Scope</a>, <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Optical-Power-Meters/CSM1-Contractor-Series-Optical-Power-Meter ">CSM1-2 Contractor Series Power Meter</a>, <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Optical-Light-Sources/CSS1-MM-Contractor-Series-Dual-LED-Source ">CSS1-MM Contractor Series Multimode Light Source</a> and <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Optical-Light-Sources/CSS1-SM-Contractor-Series-Dual-Laser-Source ">CSS1-SM Single-mode Light Source</a> options.<br />
        <br />
        The FCP2 Basic Cleaning Kits are ideal for field use and include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
