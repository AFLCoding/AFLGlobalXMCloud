        Tukwila, WA and Spartanburg, SC – Light Brigade, AFL’s training and education division, and Glenn International, a leading supplier of telecom, electrical and lighting equipment in the Caribbean and Central America, are partnering to provide certified fiber optic training in Puerto Rico. Light Brigade’s Fiber Optics 1-2-3 class will be hosted by Glenn International February 27 – March 2, 2018.<br />
        <br />
        “Restoring power and communication services after the devastation brought by Hurricane Maria over the summer has been a challenge,” explained Lee Kellett, general manager of Light Brigade. “To help with the efforts, we are bringing our 4-day Fiber Optics 1-2-3 class to the island to get more staff trained for fiber optic field work.”<br />
        <br />
        Over the past 15 years, Light Brigade and Glenn International have partnered to bring fiber optic training classes to Puerto Rico.<br />
        <br />
        Kellett continued, “We are happy to be able to return to Puerto Rico to help in a small way with the recovery efforts. Our skills training will help in the short term and provide these students with job skills that will transfer to work they can do long after the recovery.”<br />
        <br />
        The four-day class includes 16 hours of lecture and 16 hours of hands-on skills labs that provides practical understanding and skills required to properly specify, install, and maintain fiber optic networks in Telco, Broadband and Premises applications.

        Kellett continued, “We are happy to be able to return to Puerto Rico to help in a small way with the recovery efforts. Our skills training will help in the short term and provide these students with job skills that will transfer to work they can do long after the recovery.”<br />
        <br />
        The four-day class includes 16 hours of lecture and 16 hours of hands-on skills labs that provides practical understanding and skills required to properly specify, install, and maintain fiber optic networks in Telco, Broadband and Premises applications. The course is designed to provide an understanding of fiber optic technology, how fiber works, industry standards and best practices. Knowledge gained from the classroom session is then applied in two days of hands-on skills exercises. The course also provides the required training to complete an ETA International Fiber Optic Installer certification exam at the end of class.<br />
