        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and accessories, introduces the Fujikura large diameter cleaver family. The&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0BC88231EF5D46C984DEAF0F3EA9EFD2&amp;_z=z">CT-104+ fiber cleaver</a>&nbsp;features a manual clamping system that supports 80 to 600 &micro;m cladding diameter. The&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F151ABBB387443BCB4D123DEDBDDCEA3&amp;_z=z">CT-105+ fiber cleaver</a>&nbsp;features an automatic clamping system for fiber with 80 to 1,250 &micro;m cladding diameter. The&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B3D0F41A3E634FACAF975855E8BAA361&amp;_z=z">CT-106+ fiber cleaver</a>&nbsp;features an automatic clamping system for fiber with 80 to 1,250 &micro;m cladding diameter and an angled cleaving function (up to 15&deg; on fibers up to 800 &micro;m).
        &ldquo;Since the introduction of an LDF cleaving family several years ago, Fujikura has continued to review the technology and manufacture innovative products that align with changes in market conditions,&rdquo; explained Brad Hendrix, Specialty Global Market Manager for AFL. &ldquo;This is the next step in the evolution of an already great product.&rdquo; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The CT105+/CT-106+ cleavers feature a new technology that finds the optimum clamping force automatically and accurately. All LDF cleavers in this series consist of a color LCD that shows cleaving progress and recommended insert size depending on fiber coating and cladding diameter. Cleaving programs can be saved and stored to a PC or tablet using a USB port.<br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and accessories, introduces the Fujikura large diameter cleaver family. The&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=0BC88231EF5D46C984DEAF0F3EA9EFD2&amp;_z=z">CT-104+ fiber cleaver</a>&nbsp;features a manual clamping system that supports 80 to 600 &micro;m cladding diameter. The&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F151ABBB387443BCB4D123DEDBDDCEA3&amp;_z=z">CT-105+ fiber cleaver</a>&nbsp;features an automatic clamping system for fiber with 80 to 1,250 &micro;m cladding diameter. The&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B3D0F41A3E634FACAF975855E8BAA361&amp;_z=z">CT-106+ fiber cleaver</a>&nbsp;features an automatic clamping system for fiber with 80 to 1,250 &micro;m cladding diameter and an angled cleaving function (up to 15&deg; on fibers up to 800 &micro;m).
        &ldquo;Since the introduction of an LDF cleaving family several years ago, Fujikura has continued to review the technology and manufacture innovative products that align with changes in market conditions,&rdquo; explained Brad Hendrix, Specialty Global Market Manager for AFL. &ldquo;This is the next step in the evolution of an already great product.&rdquo; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The CT105+/CT-106+ cleavers feature a new technology that finds the optimum clamping force automatically and accurately. All LDF cleavers in this series consist of a color LCD that shows cleaving progress and recommended insert size depending on fiber coating and cladding diameter. Cleaving programs can be saved and stored to a PC or tablet using a USB port.<br />
