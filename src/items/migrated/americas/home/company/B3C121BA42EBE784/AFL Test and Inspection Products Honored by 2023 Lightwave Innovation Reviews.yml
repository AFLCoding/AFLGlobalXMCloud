        <p><span>Spartanburg, S.C. |&nbsp;<em>February 8, 2023</em> | </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">AFL</span></a><span> announced today that two of its test and inspection products were recognized among the best by the 2023 Lightwave Innovation Reviews. An esteemed and experienced panel of judges from the optical communications community recognized AFL as a high-scoring honoree. Both&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Test-Management-and-Reporting-Software/FlexReporter-Software-Suite"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">FlexReporter&trade; Software Platform</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Inspection-and-Cleaning/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-Lightning2-Multi-Fiber-Connector-Inspection-System"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">FOCIS Lightning&reg;2 Multi-Fiber Optic Connector Inspection System</span></a><span> received a 4.0 ranking. Scoring is based on originality, innovation, positive impact on the customer, cost-effectiveness and how well it addresses a new or existing requirement.</span></p>
        <p><span>&ldquo;We are honored that AFL&rsquo;s FlexReporter and FOCIS Lightning2 were recognized among the best during this year's Lightwave Innovation Reviews," said Charlie Collias, Global Product Marketing Manager. "Both products provide critical information on the performance or maintenance of a fiber network, which is important for today's high-bandwidth demand. They are designed to be extremely fast in their operation, simple to use with little to no training needed." </span></p>
        <p><span>Capable of generating reports for thousands of fibers at one time, FlexReporter leverages cloud technology to become the most scalable report generation platform in the industry. It combines FlexApp, a mobile App that wirelessly transfers test results to FlexReporter-Cloud from the field with FlexReports, a fast, comprehensive, 3-step PC software reporting solution. Additional features include comprehensive OTDR, OLTS and Inspection reporting capability, simple report navigation with hyperlinked test reports and reporting flexibility and customization with Report Wizard configurations.</span></p>
        <p><span>FOCIS Lightning2 is engineered to dramatically facilitate and streamline fiber connector inspection, thus enabling service providers, enterprise and data center operators to efficiently inspect and validate their fiber connectivity. This inspection tool features a self-contained, palm-sized design and one-button operation which make inspecting crowded fiber patch bays quick and easy. Its large, high-resolution LCD touch screen improves visibility of MPO and single-fiber connectors for advanced analysis.</span></p>
        <p><span>&ldquo;On behalf of the Lightwave Innovation Reviews, I would like to congratulate AFL on their high-scoring honoree status,&rdquo; said Lightwave Editorial Director, Stephen Hardy. &ldquo;This competitive program allows Lightwave to celebrate and recognize the most innovative products impacting the optical communications community this year.&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p><span>Spartanburg, S.C. |&nbsp;<em>February 8, 2023</em> | </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">AFL</span></a><span> announced today that two of its test and inspection products were recognized among the best by the 2023 Lightwave Innovation Reviews. An esteemed and experienced panel of judges from the optical communications community recognized AFL as a high-scoring honoree. Both&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Test-Management-and-Reporting-Software/FlexReporter-Software-Suite"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">FlexReporter&trade; Software Platform</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Inspection-and-Cleaning/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-Lightning2-Multi-Fiber-Connector-Inspection-System"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">FOCIS Lightning&reg;2 Multi-Fiber Optic Connector Inspection System</span></a><span> received a 4.0 ranking. Scoring is based on originality, innovation, positive impact on the customer, cost-effectiveness and how well it addresses a new or existing requirement.</span></p>
        <p><span>&ldquo;We are honored that AFL&rsquo;s FlexReporter and FOCIS Lightning2 were recognized among the best during this year's Lightwave Innovation Reviews," said Charlie Collias, Global Product Marketing Manager. "Both products provide critical information on the performance or maintenance of a fiber network, which is important for today's high-bandwidth demand. They are designed to be extremely fast in their operation, simple to use with little to no training needed." </span></p>
        <p><span>Capable of generating reports for thousands of fibers at one time, FlexReporter leverages cloud technology to become the most scalable report generation platform in the industry. It combines FlexApp, a mobile App that wirelessly transfers test results to FlexReporter-Cloud from the field with FlexReports, a fast, comprehensive, 3-step PC software reporting solution. Additional features include comprehensive OTDR, OLTS and Inspection reporting capability, simple report navigation with hyperlinked test reports and reporting flexibility and customization with Report Wizard configurations.</span></p>
        <p><span>FOCIS Lightning2 is engineered to dramatically facilitate and streamline fiber connector inspection, thus enabling service providers, enterprise and data center operators to efficiently inspect and validate their fiber connectivity. This inspection tool features a self-contained, palm-sized design and one-button operation which make inspecting crowded fiber patch bays quick and easy. Its large, high-resolution LCD touch screen improves visibility of MPO and single-fiber connectors for advanced analysis.</span></p>
        <p><span>&ldquo;On behalf of the Lightwave Innovation Reviews, I would like to congratulate AFL on their high-scoring honoree status,&rdquo; said Lightwave Editorial Director, Stephen Hardy. &ldquo;This competitive program allows Lightwave to celebrate and recognize the most innovative products impacting the optical communications community this year.&rdquo;</span></p>
