        <p><span style="color: black;">Spartanburg, S.C. |&nbsp;<em>March 2, 2023</em> | </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">AFL</span></a><span style="color: black;"> enhances fiber preparation and protection for fusion splicing with Fujikura&rsquo;s new lineup of specialty fusion splicing accessories: the </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Recoaters-and-Splice-Protection/FSR-115-FSR-116-and-FSR-117-Optical-Fiber-Recoaters"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">FSR-115, FSR-116 and FSR-117 Optical Fiber Recoaters</span></a><span style="color: black;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Cleavers/CT-114-CT-115-and-CT-116-Fiber-Cleavers"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">CT-114, CT-115 and CT-116 Fiber Cleavers</span></a><span style="color: black;">. Engineered with capability and performance in mind, these high-performance tools help improve reliability and reproducibility, resulting in a higher degree of confidence for those who utilize these products. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">&ldquo;These new product lines from Fujikura are an exciting leap in the evolution for these high-end accessories,&rdquo; said Lucas Mays, Product Line Manager for Fusion Splicers and Accessories at AFL. &ldquo;Regardless of the application or need, these products have been created to service the complex needs of those utilizing specialty optical fibers.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">The FSR series is designed for applications with flexible packaging requirements, high strength and high reliability splices, softer coatings for gyroscope splices and low-index coatings for power delivery. With an enhanced pumping mechanism and new glass mold design, pump time and recoat length accuracy are improved. Additionally, its radio-frequency identification (RFID) mold recognition feature enables the FSR to automatically limit selectable recoat modes in the user interface, thus accelerating application changeover and serving as a production control measure. Its user-exchangeable inserts further facilitate ease of changeover by enabling precise concentricity in any application. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Designed with automation and ease-of-use in mind, these high-quality, large diameter fiber (LDF) cleavers are built to achieve low cleave angles with pristine end-faces for a vast array of fiber types. Each unit in this new LDF cleaver product line is capable of more 200,000 cleaves per blade for 250 &mu;m fiber, an unheard-of long blade life. The automatic fiber clamping, backstop adjustment and blade position change capabilities of the CT-115 and CT-116 result in high performance and highly repeatable cleave angles with little hassle even with complicated fiber types. Its industry-leading RFID fiber holder identification feature allows users to easily pair a fiber holder to a cleave mode based on the unique RFID tag of each fiber holder. This process can be used as either a process control measure, or to aid in cleave optimization</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">&ldquo;Fujikura innovation does not disappoint," continued Mays. "These products provide value in response to direct requests from our customers and showcase the quality solutions Fujikura develops to exceed those expectations." </span></p>

        <p><span style="color: black;">Spartanburg, S.C. |&nbsp;<em>March 2, 2023</em> | </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">AFL</span></a><span style="color: black;"> enhances fiber preparation and protection for fusion splicing with Fujikura&rsquo;s new lineup of specialty fusion splicing accessories: the </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Recoaters-and-Splice-Protection/FSR-115-FSR-116-and-FSR-117-Optical-Fiber-Recoaters"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">FSR-115, FSR-116 and FSR-117 Optical Fiber Recoaters</span></a><span style="color: black;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Cleavers/CT-114-CT-115-and-CT-116-Fiber-Cleavers"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">CT-114, CT-115 and CT-116 Fiber Cleavers</span></a><span style="color: black;">. Engineered with capability and performance in mind, these high-performance tools help improve reliability and reproducibility, resulting in a higher degree of confidence for those who utilize these products. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">&ldquo;These new product lines from Fujikura are an exciting leap in the evolution for these high-end accessories,&rdquo; said Lucas Mays, Product Line Manager for Fusion Splicers and Accessories at AFL. &ldquo;Regardless of the application or need, these products have been created to service the complex needs of those utilizing specialty optical fibers.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">The FSR series is designed for applications with flexible packaging requirements, high strength and high reliability splices, softer coatings for gyroscope splices and low-index coatings for power delivery. With an enhanced pumping mechanism and new glass mold design, pump time and recoat length accuracy are improved. Additionally, its radio-frequency identification (RFID) mold recognition feature enables the FSR to automatically limit selectable recoat modes in the user interface, thus accelerating application changeover and serving as a production control measure. Its user-exchangeable inserts further facilitate ease of changeover by enabling precise concentricity in any application. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Designed with automation and ease-of-use in mind, these high-quality, large diameter fiber (LDF) cleavers are built to achieve low cleave angles with pristine end-faces for a vast array of fiber types. Each unit in this new LDF cleaver product line is capable of more 200,000 cleaves per blade for 250 &mu;m fiber, an unheard-of long blade life. The automatic fiber clamping, backstop adjustment and blade position change capabilities of the CT-115 and CT-116 result in high performance and highly repeatable cleave angles with little hassle even with complicated fiber types. Its industry-leading RFID fiber holder identification feature allows users to easily pair a fiber holder to a cleave mode based on the unique RFID tag of each fiber holder. This process can be used as either a process control measure, or to aid in cleave optimization</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">&ldquo;Fujikura innovation does not disappoint," continued Mays. "These products provide value in response to direct requests from our customers and showcase the quality solutions Fujikura develops to exceed those expectations." </span></p>
