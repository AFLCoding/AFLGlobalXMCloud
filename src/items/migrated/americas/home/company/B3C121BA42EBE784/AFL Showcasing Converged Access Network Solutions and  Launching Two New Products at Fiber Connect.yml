These include the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Splice-Closures/Apex-Fiber-Optic-Splice-Closures/Apex-X-3-Sealed-Splice-Closure">Apex&reg; X-3</a>, a new addition to the Apex family of  fiber optic splice closures, and the<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Wall-Mounted-Enclosures-and-Panels/Outdoor-and-Pedestal-Mount/LightLink-POLY-LL-5D-Optical-Splicing-and-Distribution-Enclosure"> LL-5D Optical Splicing and  Distribution Enclosure (LL-5D)</a> among other products and solutions that build and support a &nbsp;<a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/converged-access-network">Converged  Access Network</a>. </p>
        <p>Built to be expandable,  flexible and accessible, AFL&rsquo;s <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/converged-access-network">Converged  Access Network</a> is  designed to meet the growing demands of the future. AFL&rsquo;s solutions can help build a  network in a range of application areas, including 5G Fronthaul/Backhaul, FTTX  and Multiple Dwelling Unit/Multiple Tenant Units (MXU). </p>
        <p>On the show floor, AFL  will introduce the Apex X-3, the largest in its family of splice closures, which  has a maximum capacity of 5,184 fibers, when using 200 &micro;m SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg;  (SWR&reg;). The initial  launch of Apex splice closures introduced the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Splice-Closures/Apex-Fiber-Optic-Splice-Closures/Apex-X-2-Sealed-Splice-Closure.aspx">X-2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Splice-Closures/Apex-Fiber-Optic-Splice-Closures/Apex-X-2S-Sealed-Splice-Closure.aspx">X-2S</a> models, which have maximum capacities of and 3,456 and 1,728 fibers, respectively, when using 200 &micro;m SWR.  With its wedge-based sealing system, the cable strain relief allows a cable to  be installed into the closure and sealed in seconds, reducing overall installation  time. </p>
        <p>LL-5D Optical Splicing  and Distribution Enclosure is designed for organizing, splicing and  interconnecting fibers in broadband FTTx, distribution and building entrance  applications. The LL-5D features a durable outdoor polymer-based material  engineered to ensure strength and durability. Additionally, the LL-5D has an  ambidextrous removeable door that can be easily reinstalled for left or right  hinged applications. It can also support up to 144 single fiber splices with the  use of a pre-molded splice tray and two additional Apex X-2S universal splice  trays. </p>
