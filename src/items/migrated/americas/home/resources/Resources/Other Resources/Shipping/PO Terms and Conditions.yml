            <strong>Contract; No Additional Terms:</strong> This PO will become a binding contract upon (a) Seller’s written acceptance of this PO, (b) Seller’s shipment of any permitted unit or partial unit of the Work or performance of any Work, or (c) other conduct by Seller recognizing the existence of a contract. This PO is an offer, limited to its terms, and Company objects to any additional or conflicting terms and conditions in Seller’s acceptance of this PO. No different or additional term in Seller’s acceptance, invoice or other document can become part of the contract without Company’s written consent.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Warranty:</strong> Seller represents and warrants to Company (a) that title to the Work is good, marketable and free and clear of all liens, taxes, charges, or other encumbrances; (b) that the Work is and will be free from all defects in design, workmanship, and materials for a period of one year after the final acceptance of the Work, or such longer period as may be otherwise provided on the face of this PO; (c) that the Work is fit for its ordinary intended purposes and any purposes specified herein or reasonably known to Seller; (d) that the Work conforms to the descriptions on its labeling and packaging; (e) that the Work and its components are new and not previously used (unless specifically designated on the face of this PO as refurbished, rebuilt, or used), (f) that the Work conforms to Company’s specifications, drawings, plans, and other documents furnished to Seller; and that the Work is merchantable and of good quality and workmanship. If Seller breaches this warranty, Seller, at Company’s option, will either repair the defective Work, replace the defective Work or refund the purchase price. If Company selects repair or replacement, any defects will be remedied by Seller without cost to Company, including but not limited to, the costs of removal, shipping, repair and replacement of the defective Work, and reinstallation of new Work, all of which shall be paid by Seller. All such defective Work that is so remedied will be similarly warranted as stated above. If the Work involves the sale of goods, this transaction will be governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, latest revision, as enacted by the State of South Carolina, including all warranty protection (express or implied) and all buyer remedies.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Intellectual Property Rights; License:</strong> Seller agrees to indemnify, defend, reimburse and save harmless Company, its customers and users of the Work or products related to the Work, from any and all liabilities, demands, claims, losses, actions, damages and expenses of any nature or kind, including, without limitation attorneys’ fees and court costs, arising out of any infringement or alleged infringement of patents, trademarks, copyrights, industrial design or process, trade secrets, or any other intellectual property right arising out of or relating to Company’s purchase, use or sale of the Work supplied under a PO. Seller further agrees to defend, at Seller’s expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, any and all suits or actions, based on such claims. All such obligations of Seller to indemnify, reimburse, hold harmless, protect and defend Company and its successors and assigns are in addition to Seller’s warranty obligations and all other rights or remedies of the Company and will survive acceptance and use of, and payment for the Work and completion, termination, or cancellation of a PO. Seller irrevocably waives any claim against the Company, its affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, assigns, customers and users of the Work, that such infringement arose out of the Company, its affiliates, subsidiaries, their successors and assigns’ specifications. Seller hereby grants Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective successors and assigns, and Company hereby accepts, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license, including the right to sublicense to others in connection with the Work, under (i) patents, industrial designs, technical information, know-how, processes of manufacture and other intellectual property, owned or controlled by Seller or its affiliates and relating to the Work; and (ii) any works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression (including drawings, prints, manuals and specifications) furnished by Seller in the course of Seller’s activity under a PO, to reproduce, distribute and display such works and to prepare derivative works based thereon, subject to the other provisions of a PO (all items in clauses (i) and (ii) above, collectively “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seller’s Intellectual Property</span>”, and such license the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">License</span>”.) Seller acknowledges and understands that this License shall be effective from the first date of delivery of the Work under a PO (or such earlier date as specified below) and extend for so long as the Company or its subsidiaries and affiliates, have contractual obligations to customers relating to the Work.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Quality Assurance; Audits; Inspection:</strong> Seller represents and warrants that it has and will maintain an adequate quality control/assurance program with respect to the Work and that it creates and maintains adequate quality control/assurance reports, certificates, affidavits, and other such records relating to the Work. The Company will have at any time the right to inspect the Work and, to the extent applicable, perform any and all, tests, and audits deemed necessary or convenient by the Company or its agent. Seller agrees to provide the Company, its employees, agents or representatives, access to its facilities at all reasonable times for such inspection, tests, and audits, and, at no additional cost, to provide all assistance and facilities reasonably necessary to perform the same. Neither the inspection, testing, or auditing of any of the Work, nor the failure to do so, before delivery to the Company shall constitute acceptance of any Work, or relieve Seller from exclusive responsibility for furnishing Work in strict conformance with the Company’s specifications. Seller agrees that, upon request and at no additional charge, it will promptly furnish authenticated copies thereof, as well as applicable certificates of conformance and/ or compliance acceptable to Company, at the time of, or promptly after, delivery. Company’s right to audit Seller includes the right to request from Seller, following reasonable notice to Seller, evidence of Seller’s formation, good standing, if applicable, registration with the corresponding governmental offices and/or registries, copies of official identifications for Seller’s legal representatives signing any documents, current unaudited and audited financial statements, as well as evidence of compliance by Seller with its legal, tax, labor and other obligations at the federal, state and local level. The Work will be received subject to inspection and approval by the Company after delivery. Upon inspection, the Company may give Seller notice of rejection or revocation of acceptance, notwithstanding any payment, approval, prior test or inspection. No inspection, approval, test, delay or failure to inspect or test, or failure to discover any defect or other nonconformance, will relieve Seller of any obligations under these Terms and Conditions or impair or waive any right or remedy of the Company with respect to Seller’s performance hereunder. If, in the Company’s judgment, the Work does not conform with the requirements of a PO, the Company will have the right to reject the Work and, in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have, the Company may, in its sole discretion: (1) return any or all nonconforming Work to Seller for reimbursement, credit, replacement, or repair as the Company may direct; (2) correct, rework, and/or repair the Work with all costs associated therewith to be charged to and paid by Seller; or (3) hold any or all nonconforming Work, at Seller’s risk and expense, for disposal or correction according to Seller’s instructions. Any Work rejected by the Company and returned to Seller will be returned, at Seller’s risk and expense, with the cost of packaging, handling, inspection, examination, transportation and any other costs incidental thereto to be charged to and paid by Seller. Such Work will not thereafter be tendered to the Company for acceptance unless the previous rejection and requirement of correction are disclosed to the Company in writing. All such nonconforming Work that are so remedied will have the same warranty as stated in a PO.</li>
            <li>

Also, Seller will name Company as an additional insured by endorsement to the policies on its Commercial General Liability and Automobile Liability policies. Seller’s insurance will be primary without right of contribution of any other insurance carried by or on behalf of Company. Upon Company’s request, Seller will provide Company with written certification, reasonably acceptable to Company, of Seller’s compliance with the requirements listed in this Section 9. The requirements in this Section 9 are separate and distinct from any other obligations of Seller under a PO. All insurance obtained by Sellers pursuant to this Section 9 shall be issued in compliance with the laws applicable to the specific jurisdiction where the Work will be performed, including, as applicable, being issued by insurance companies authorized to provide insurance in the specific jurisdiction.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Price Warranties and Competitiveness:</strong> Seller represents and warrants that the prices for the Work are, and shall ensure that such prices remain, no less favorable to the Company than the prices currently extended to any other customer of Seller for the same or substantially similar Work, in the same or substantially similar quantities and delivery requirements.

Further, Seller shall ensure that the Work remains competitive in terms of price, technology and quality, with substantially similar goods and services available to the Company from other suppliers. Unless applicable, Seller represents and warrants that the prices in a PO shall be complete, and no surcharges, premiums or other additional charges of any type shall be added (except if such surcharges, premiums or additional charges are reflected in the face of a PO), without the Company’s prior written consent.

            <strong>Company’s Property and Parts:</strong> All property of any kind supplied to Seller, or paid for by Company, if any, will be and remain the Company’s property, and Seller will maintain such property in good condition and repair, except to the extent that such property is integrated into Work rendered hereunder. Materials or parts provided by, or on behalf of, Company which have been, or are to be, processed by Seller are consigned to Seller solely for purposes of such processing and remain Company’s property. All Company property, while in Seller’s custody or control, will be held at Seller’s risk, free of all liens, encumbrances or security interests of Seller or third parties, and will be kept insured by Seller at Seller’s expense in an amount equal to the replacement cost with loss payable to Company.

Seller will notify the Company within ten (10) days after entering into any negotiations that could lead to the situation specified in subsection (iv) above, provided that upon Seller’s request, the Company will enter into an appropriate nondisclosure agreement related to information disclosed to the Company in relation to such transaction. (b) Seller may terminate a PO only for non-payment of the purchase price for Work which are one hundred twenty (120) or more days past due and material in amount, and then only if: (i) Seller first provides the Company written notice specifying the amounts past due (including the relevant PO and invoices numbers and dates) and Seller’s intent to terminate a PO if the past due amount is not paid; and (ii) the Company, within sixty (60) days of such notice, does not either: (A) pay the past due amounts, or (B) notify Seller that the amounts claimed to be unpaid are disputed by the Company.

Company will have the right to set off against or to recoup from any payment or other obligation owed to Seller, in whole or in part, any amounts due to Company or its affiliates or subsidiaries from Seller or its affiliates or subsidiaries. The Company will provide Seller with a statement describing any offset or recoupment taken by Company.

            <strong>Independent Contractor:</strong> The relationship between Seller and Company is that of independent contractors. Seller is not an employee or agent of Company. Nothing contained in these Terms and Conditions shall be construed to create a principal-agent or employer-employee relationship between the parties. Neither party shall represent to others that it is the agent of the other. Seller is not eligible for Company benefits or employee plans.

To the extent applicable, Seller is obligated to use workers and employees that have been previously registered with any mandatory social security or similar agencies. Breach of this provision will subject Seller to the payment of all damages caused to the Company with the Company also having the right to immediately terminate a PO without the need for judicial involvement or declaration.</li>

            <strong>Assignment:</strong> This PO cannot be assigned, transferred or delegated without Company’s prior written consent.
