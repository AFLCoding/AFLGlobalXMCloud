        AFL provides optimized fiber optic cables for the oil and gas industry<br />
         </h2>
        <p>
        The global demand for oil and gas has caused rapid expansion and investment to replace an infrastructure that has not changed significantly over the last few decades. The industry as a whole recognizes the need for improved monitoring systems. Fiber optic installation is a key component of the expansion, allowing companies to leverage the advantages offered by fiber while improving operational performance and accuracy.</p>
        <p>
        The oil and gas industry requires very specific cabling and connectivity requirements to ensure safety, productivity and durability in harsh environments. <a href="/Solutions/Underwater-and-subsea.aspx">Downhole equipment</a> must be reliable and able to withstand heat, pressure, moisture, corrosion and vibration.</p>
        <p>
        Fiber optics for oil and gas serve as links for data, control and for sensing of various attributes. Since fiber optics offer large bandwidth in a compact cable, size, weight and installation time are reduced. With sensor applications, fiber optic solutions provide a wide range of data about environmental conditions such as temperature, oil reserve levels and equipment performance or status.</p>
        <p>
        As drilling moves further offshore, traditional copper wire will not handle the distance due to limitations in bandwidth. It will become imperative to employ fiber optic technologies that allow increased and improved data generation and analysis. AFL is already assisting customers deploying acoustic and distributed temperature monitoring.<br />
         </p>

        <h2>Splicing and Optimization Services</h2>
        <p>
        AFL can also provide custom engineering services for special splicing or fiber preparation applications. These services may include custom hardware or software design, and process improvement consultation. Services may also include advanced splicer training and maintenance service agreements.</p>
        <p>Additionally, if your company is developing a new optical component and/or requires a critical splice, AFL may be able to fabricate spliced components, such as dissimilar fiber splicing, ball lens, tapers, TEC, combiners and MFAs to help accelerate your time to market.</p>
        <p>As the need for more sophisticated fiber optics develops, AFL remains on the leading edge in the customization of cables using different alloys and outer encapsulations. Through relationships with equipment manufacturers and a thorough understanding of customer needs in the market, AFL is able to serve this high-tech industry with a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E545E2A90D414F31BDD0BA9B8ED27FD0&_z=z">cable portfolio</a> no other company can offer.</p>

        <h2>AFL provides optimized fiber optic cables for the oil and gas industry</h2>
        <p>The global demand for oil and gas has caused rapid expansion and investment to replace an infrastructure that has not changed significantly over the last few decades. The industry as a whole recognizes the need for improved monitoring systems. Fiber optic installation is a key component of the expansion, allowing companies to leverage the advantages offered by fiber while improving operational performance and accuracy.</p>
        <p>The oil and gas industry requires very specific cabling and connectivity requirements to ensuresafety, productivity and durability in harsh environments.<a href="/Solutions/Underwater-and-subsea" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">Downhole equipment</a>must be reliable and able to withstand heat, pressure, moisture, corrosion and vibration.</p>
        <p>Fiber optics for oil and gas serve as links for data, control and for sensing of various attributes. Since fiber optics offer large bandwidth in a compact cable, size, weight and installation time are reduced. With sensor applications, fiber optic solutions provide a wide range of data about environmental conditions such as temperature, oil reserve levels and equipment performance or status.</p>
        <p>As drilling moves further offshore, traditional copper wire will not handle the distance due to limitations in bandwidth. It will become imperative to employ fiber optic technologies that allow increased and improved data generation and analysis. AFL is already assisting customers deploying acoustic and distributed temperature monitoring.</p>
