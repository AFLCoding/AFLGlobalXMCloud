        <br />
        Each year, AFL awards a four-year scholarship to the son or daughter of a North American-based AFL associate entering a college or university. This award recognizes students that have stellar academics, achievements and community service, and provides $2,000 per year for four years toward the cost of tuition, room/board, books and more. The scholarship was named in memory of Toshihide Naruse, Managing Director of Fujikura, AFL&rsquo;s parent company. Mr. Naruse&rsquo;s contributions to AFL were significant, and because of his personal interest in higher education, AFL continues to honor his memory.<br />
