        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, announced today a multi-year partnership with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.milb.com/greenville">Greenville Drive</a>, an advanced Class A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox and &ldquo;front porch&rdquo; of the Upstate community. This partnership announcement, a major development for both organizations, will enhance AFL&rsquo;s community visibility, marketing capabilities, and relationship development efforts, while engaging and spotlighting AFL associates, customers and key stakeholders.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;The Greenville Drive takes baseball to another level&mdash;from entertainment to networking events to community engagement&mdash;the Drive continues to reinvent itself year after year, offering a unique venue that engages the entire community on a broader level,&rdquo; explained Jody Gallagher, President and CEO of AFL. &ldquo;Partnering with the Greenville Drive will provide a great opportunity for AFL to broaden our engagement in our community in a different and much larger way.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        As part of the partnership, AFL will be prominently featured across a wide range of Fluor Field visibility touchpoints including outfield signage, the award-winning Greenville Drive Magazine, all Drive digital owned media channels (website, social media and CRM e-blasts), as well as special and highly engaging features during Drive games each season. In addition, the Drive and AFL will collaborate each Drive season on exciting event integration opportunities aligned with AFL&rsquo;s community outreach priorities (children, education and workforce) as well as hospitality events to further showcase and recognize AFL associates from our community and beyond.<br />
        <br />
        "I can&rsquo;t tell you how excited and proud we are to officially announce our new partnership with AFL&rdquo;, said Drive Owner and Team President Craig Brown. &ldquo;AFL&rsquo;s commitment to product innovation, the community, and their employees is second to none and we eagerly look forward to spotlighting many of AFL&rsquo;s unique initiatives at Fluor Field in 2021 and for years to come.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        Deemed the &ldquo;Front Porch of the Community,&rdquo; the Greenville Drive was recently recognized as the recipient of Baseball America&rsquo;s 2020 Bob Freitas Award, further validating the organization&rsquo;s commitment to making the Upstate a stronger region, and given to franchises that have demonstrated &ldquo;long-term success and sustained excellence in the business of Minor League baseball.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        Headquartered in Spartanburg, AFL employs more than 5,200 associates worldwide with over 1,100 calling the Upstate home. AFL has multiple facilities in the Upstate and across the United States as well as international facilities in Mexico, Canada, Europe, Asia and Australia.
