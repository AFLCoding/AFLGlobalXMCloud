        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable and equipment, was recognized among the best in the industry by the 2019 Cabling Installation & Maintenance Innovators Awards. The third-party judging panel included cabling and communications system specifiers, designers, integrators and managers with vast professional experience.<br />
        <br />
        AFL was the recipient of three awards:<br />
        <br />
        • Platinum – Bluetooth®-enabled Splicing Family (<a href="https://youtu.be/_7m3GY5WffY">click here</a> for video)<br />
        • Gold – <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A1055BC9C33B40258E0F1C3DAC9D2B44&_z=z">FlexScan® Quad OTDR</a><br />
        • Silver – <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=20242C1BCD984C08B5684793B2F54606&_z=z">FOCIS Lightning Multi-fiber Connector Inspection System</a> (<a href="https://youtu.be/i6h2do8a3xc">click here</a> for video)<br />
        <br />
        “On behalf of the Cabling Installation & Maintenance Innovators Awards, I would like to congratulate AFL on their Platinum, Gold and Silver–level honoree status,” said Cabling Installation & Maintenance’s Chief Editor Patrick McLaughlin. “This competitive, unbiased program celebrates the most original and innovative products in the Industry.”<br />
        <br />
        Fujikura has introduced a new generation of splicing equipment that provides Bluetooth communication between splicer and fiber preparation accessories. Specifically, the Fujikura <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EC9760CA48424C4BB3FC3F636E8227E5&_z=z">CT50 fiber cleaver</a> which utilizes a cleave-counting mechanism managed internally from which the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=750EE63900404AB2B3DDC1AB825DD815&_z=z">splicer</a> continuously reads to track cleaver blade wear and overall life. This innovation reduces time, cost and hassle spent on tool upkeep, so technicians can focus on network installation.<br />
        <br />
        The FlexScan Quad OTDR is designed specifically for contract installers and network operators deploying and maintaining both single-mode and multimode networks, including FTTH PONs, POLANs and point-to-point networks. In addition to new multimode test capability, the FlexScan OTDR consists of a larger, higher-resolution (800x480) gesture-recognition touchscreen display, integrated user-configurable Print-to-PDF, longer battery life plus improved Bluetooth/WiFi communications.<br />
        <br />
        FOCIS Lightning is a self-contained multi-fiber connector inspection probe, intended specifically for the inspection of multi-fiber connectors and bulkheads such as MPO and MTP®. With twin 5M pixel CMOS sensors to image the entire MPO end face simultaneously, FOCIS Lightning performs multi-fiber inspections 10 to 100 times faster than legacy systems. This full view connector end face image is displayed in less than two seconds from power-on.<br />
