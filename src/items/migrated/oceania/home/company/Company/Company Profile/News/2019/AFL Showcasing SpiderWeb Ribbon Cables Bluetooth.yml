Featured products consist of AFL’s latest technologies including Ultra Heavy Duty MicroCore® with SpiderWeb Ribbon® (SWR®), Wrapping Tube Cable, the Fujikura 41S fusion splicer with Bluetooth® technology, board level optical connectivity solutions and more.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6A0E54E6BB4F482E84B1C2C7F254796A&_z=z">Ultra HD MicroCore with SpiderWeb Ribbon</a> is the latest development in flame-rated SWR technology cables and allows for a fully integrated, end-to-end solution. The cable supports high fiber density deployments in data center and central office installation environments and is designed to optimize splicing efficiency when interconnected with AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=700FA7F356564DF8AA34C82971BFE193&_z=z">Wrapping Tube Cable</a> (WTC), a fiber optic cable that provides the smallest cable diameter and lowest weight, high-fiber count ribbon cable in the industry.<br />
        <br />
        Also featured will be the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=750EE63900404AB2B3DDC1AB825DD815&_z=z">Fujikura 41S Fusion Splicer</a>, a fully ruggedized, active cladding alignment fusion splicer. Core sensing loss estimation technology provides the most accurate assessment of splice loss available in any active cladding alignment splicer in the world. State-of-the-art cleaver management via a Bluetooth connection with the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EC9760CA48424C4BB3FC3F636E8227E5&_z=z">Fujikura CT50 Cleaver</a> tracks usage and enables automated blade rotation.<br />
        <br />
        Products for board level optical connectivity solutions that support ultra-fast networking and high performance computing equipment will also be showcased. These solutions link embedded optical modules to the card edge, blind-mate mid-plane connectors and backplane solutions. AFL is offering blind-mate mid-plane and backplane connectivity solutions using Fujikura’s lensed single-mode MT ferrule.<br />
        <br />
        Lastly, AFL will feature the 12-fiber, 80 µm MPO connector which supports the continued drive by module and switch manufacturers to increase fiber and port density. Fujikura has developed a family of short length MPO receptacle connectors for modules with significant internal space constraints. Some receptacles can be assembled after MPO termination. Solutions are provided for both 3.5 mm and 8 mm MT ferrules.<br />
