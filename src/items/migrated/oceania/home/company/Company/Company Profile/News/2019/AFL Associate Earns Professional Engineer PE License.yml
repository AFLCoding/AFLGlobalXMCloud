        <div style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;">Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, announces that Eddie Collins, process engineer for AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E545E2A90D414F31BDD0BA9B8ED27FD0&_z=z">fiber optic cable</a> division, has received his Professional Engineer (PE) license awarded by the South Carolina State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Surveyors. After receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Auburn University, he started working for Thermasys Corporation, pioneering improvements in many different applications, before joining AFL in 2011.</div>
        <div style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;"><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/Eddie-Collins.aspx" target="_blank" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">
        <br />
        </a>“Becoming a Professional Engineer has always been a goal of mine,” Eddie commented. “I am thankful to AFL for providing me with support and resources to achieve my goal.”<br />
         <br />
        In his current role at AFL, Collins has made many contributions including tool design for roll forming, sheathing armor and aluminum clad; designing a shear cutter for welding of aluminum tape; and equipment design for improved reliability and performance of cable, test and inspection equipment, and Alumoweld wire.<br />
         <br />
        “Eddie’s hard work, dedication and engineering expertise were evident in his exam preparation and with the results,” commented Daniel Belouin, process engineering manager for AFL’s cable division. “Eddie is truly as asset to the engineering team at AFL.”<br />
         <br />
        PE licensure is the highest standard of excellence in the engineering profession. Collins completed the requirements for state licensure which includes completing a four-year college degree at an accredited university, working under a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) for a period of four years and passing two exams—the Fundamentals of Engineering and the Principles and Practices of Engineering.<br />
