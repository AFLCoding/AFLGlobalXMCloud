        <div>Kent, WA and Spartanburg, SC – June 9, 2020 – Light Brigade, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=CB5A0B73F40540109C53688EDA61E0F7&_z=z">AFL’</a>s industry-leading training and education division, announced new training options for professionals in the Fiber to the Home space. FTTx Outside Plant Design and Certified Fiber to the Home Professional (CFHP) Remote Classroom courses have been added to Light Brigade’s training catalog. The live, instructor-led remote classrooms will provide students the opportunity to advance their FTTH expertise and prepare for Fiber Broadband Association certification exams.<br />
        <br />
         <br />
        FTTH Remote Classroom students receive the same quality curriculum as in-person classroom students. With a minimal time commitment, less than a week, students gain on-demand Fiber-to-the-Home knowledge and skills. Light Brigade’s experienced instructors engage students with interactive exercises and questions are answered in real-time by a technologist.<br />
         <br />
        The FTTx OSP Design Remote Classroom makes its premiere on August 10, 2020. The CFHP Remote Classroom starts on August 31, 2020. Both courses are enrolling students.<br />
         <br />
        “With this ‘new normal,’ we are pleased to be able to bring more and more of our renowned training to our customers through live, remote classrooms,” explained Lee Kellett, general manager of Light Brigade. “These FTTx courses are particularly important with the demand for added bandwidth and broader coverage to meet today’s needs.”<br />
         <br />
        Fiber Broadband Association certification indicates a professional level of technical competence in FTTH technologies. It consists of demonstrating knowledge and familiarity with FTTH architecture, network design, deployment technology and operational skills. These certifications are not directed at specific vendors’ equipment; rather it demonstrates professional competence on a broad base of FTTH topics.<br />
