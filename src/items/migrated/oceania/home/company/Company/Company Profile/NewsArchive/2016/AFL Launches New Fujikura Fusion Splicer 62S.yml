        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="qa.aflglobalsc.com/">AFL</a> is supplementing its technologically-advanced Fujikura fusion splicer product line with the <a href="/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers-Single-Fiber/Fujikura-62S-Fusion-Splicer">Fujikura 62S</a>, an active core alignment splicer featuring exceptional splice loss performance and minimized splice time. With a conventional flip-open wind protector and non-motorized tube heater, the complexity of the splicer is reduced without compromising total cycle time. Additionally, the number of steps to process splices is minimized with the auto-start feature for both the splicing and tube heating process.<br />
        <br />
        “The 62S highlights the ingenuity of Fujikura engineers to create a fusion splicer that is unique to what’s currently on the market,” stated Greg Pickeral, product manager of AFL’s fusion splicer product line. “True to Fujikura’s reputation for best-in-class products, the 62S features leading technology coupled with exceptional splice loss performance. For field technicians who need high quality and reliability, AFL’s offers a wide range of splicers, now including the 62S, suitable for the harshest of environments.”<br />
        <br />
        The Fujikura 62S ensures a high level of productivity with the 23-second shrink time using standard splice sleeves. By incorporating ruggedized features, a mirrorless optical system and impact-resistant monitor, durability is enhanced. The transit case doubles as a built-in or mobile workstation and makes splicing easier.<br />
        <br />
        Additional features of the Fujikura 62S include a 5,000 splice electrode life; Li-ion battery with 200 splices/shrinks per charge; 5 mm cleave length for splice-on connectors or small package needs; sheath clamp or fiber holder operation; and Internet software upgrades.<br />
        <br />
        AFL operates the only authorized repair facility for Fujikura splicing products in the U.S. Technical support is available 24/7 and complimentary on-site training is available with every splicer purchased.<br />
