        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="/">AFL</a> presented a $7,500 grant to <a href="http://www.gfpdrugfree.org/">Greenville Family Partnership</a> (GFP), a nonprofit organization that educates children and families about the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse. Made possible by AFL’s <a href="/Company/Community">Community Outreach Program</a>, the grant supports a high school or college intern for the organization and its annual Red Ribbon Classic.<br />
        <br />
        Through the internship program, students develop problem-solving, research and debating skills while learning how drug and alcohol abuse can affect their lives and the people around them. More importantly, interns impact an estimated five to 10 people within their circle of friends, causing more people to develop good habits and avoid substance abuse.<br />
        <br />
        “Our interns are fully integrated into the mission of GFP and learn the impact of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs and how these substances directly and indirectly influence their lives and the lives of those around them,” explained Carol Reeves, CEO and director of GFP. “Interns serve the GFP mission as teachers and role models for others within our community, positively impacting the lives of both their peers and the younger children who look up to them.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s community outreach grant also supports GFP’s annual Red Ribbon Classic, GFP’s largest fundraising event. Proceeds support their Prevention Resource Center, parent education programs and part of their community outreach efforts.<br />
        <br />
        “Drug and alcohol abuse is a growing issue in the upstate and Greenville Family Partnership is doing amazing work to educate our children, parents and community partners,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “To make an impact, it’s a joint effort that involves everyone at every level. Ultimately these efforts will make our community stronger and streets safer.”<br />
        <br />
        GFP's Red Ribbon Classic will be held Monday, Sept. 23, 2013 at the Green Valley Country Club in Greenville. Red Ribbon Week, an awareness program that focuses on local elementary schools, begins Oct. 23 and ends Oct. 31. <br />
