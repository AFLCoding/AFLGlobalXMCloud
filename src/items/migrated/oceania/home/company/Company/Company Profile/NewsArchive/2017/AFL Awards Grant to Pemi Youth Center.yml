        Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> awarded a $2,000 grant to the <a href="https://pemiyouthcenter.org/">Pemi Youth Center</a>, an organization that serves youth from 10 to 17 in the New Hampshire community. Made possible by <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">AFL’s Community Outreach Program</a>, the grant will assist in the purchase of laptops enabling students who do not have access to computers or the internet at home the ability to complete homework and other assignments that require submitting online.<br />
        <br />
        “On a national level, research suggests that Monday through Friday, 3 p.m. – 6 p.m. is a critical time period for young people. During this time there is a great need for role models who are able to tutor and mentor while parents and guardians are still at work,” commented Samantha Diemand, associate director at the Pemi Youth Center. “This is where the Pemi Youth Center comes in—we are caring for these children on a regular basis. Not only are we helping with homework, but we are also reducing problematic behaviors and providing a level of encouragement so they are more likely to feel good about themselves.”<br />
        <br />
        The Pemi Youth Center’s (PYC) mission is to provide a safe and welcoming environment where youth can gather outside of school and gain a sense of community, belonging and self-esteem. PYC offers many enriching activities that engage and educate young minds and demonstrate the importance of believing in one’s own strengths and inner resources.<br />
        <br />
        “The Pemi Youth Center focuses its efforts on students, many of whom face difficult life circumstances,” explained Kerrin Corrieri, human resources manager for AFL. “For many children, the Pemi Youth Center is a life-changing experience. Those changed habits continue on into adult years and ultimately change the landscape of our community.”<br />
