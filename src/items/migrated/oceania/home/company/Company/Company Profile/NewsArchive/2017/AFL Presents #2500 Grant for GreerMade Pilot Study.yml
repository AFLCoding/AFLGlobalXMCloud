        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading fiber optic manufacturer and provider of services, presented a $2,500 grant to the <a href="http://greerchamber.com/">Greer Chamber</a> Foundation supporting the <a href="https://greermade.com/">GreerMade</a> Pilot Study program. The pilot study will support education in advanced manufacturing at K-12 grade levels to develop skills that bridge the gap in Greer’s rapidly growing manufacturing segment.<br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/AFL_Greer_Chamber_check_media.aspx" target="_blank"></a></p>
        <p>GreerMade partnered with Clemson University’s Center for Workforce Development (CUCWD) to implement virtual reality technical education in high schools and vocational centers to raise awareness of workforce development opportunities. Digital curricula, e-learning, simulations and virtual reality modules were developed and designed to align with the Manufacturing Skills Standards Council standards.</p>
        <p>“As Greer’s manufacturing base continues to grow, we need a knowledgeable workforce to grow with it,” explained Katie Witherspoon, vice president of operations for the Greer Chamber of Commerce. “These ‘classes’ will help students enhance their core knowledge and skills for production work from entry-level to front-line supervisory level.”</p>
        <p>The curricula includes modular courses for: Safety; Quality Practices and Measurement; Manufacturing Production and Processes; Maintenance Awareness and Soft Skills. In 2018 curricula will be offered at three high schools, three middle schools and one career center, and is expected to serve about 250 students.</p>
        <p>AFL has an extensive Community Outreach Program that provides grants, sponsorships, volunteer outreach, disaster relief and more. For additional information on AFL and its community initiatives, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
