        <p>Spartanburg, SC – Last week, AFL’s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/Community-Advisory-Board.aspx">community advisory board</a> presented a $7,500 grant to the<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://www.childrenssecurityblanket.org/"> Children’s Security Blanket Inc.</a> (CSB) of Spartanburg, SC in support of the 5th annual Toys R Us Christmas Celebration. The event is an initiative to provide an opportunity for children undergoing cancer treatment, along with their siblings, to shop for Christmas presents.</p>
        <p>With extended hospital stays, medications and other expenses, finances become a struggle for the families Children’s Security Blanket support. This event helps alleviate some of the season’s money worries. During this event, CSB provided 54 children who have cancer with a $75 gift card, and their siblings with a $25 gift card.</p>
        <p>“Words of praise and appreciation will never express our most sincere thanks for receiving this grant,” said Tom Russell, CSB President and co-founder. “AFL has, without a doubt, made Christmas much happier and less stressful for over fifty families.”</p>
        <p>The mission of the Children’s Security Blanket is to provide financial support, connect those in need with those who can assist, and deliver hope to families whose children have been diagnosed with and are receiving treatment for cancer. The CSB provides transportation, lodging and meals for families as they travel to hospitals and treatment centers. The CSB also hosts a summer day camp, a monthly support group with a qualified counselor, and several events such as the Toys R Us Christmas Party to provide an atmosphere of support and happiness for the sick child.</p>
