        AFL Young Professionals (AYP)*</h2>
        <p>
        AFL formed the AYP group to cultivate a sense of community among young professionals in the organization in an effort to boost associate job satisfaction, encourage collaboration in the workplace, and foster a learning-centric work environment. The AYP group organizes professional development opportunities, community outreach outings and social events all of which members of the group will be invited to participate.</p>
        <em>*A young professional is an AFL associate in a professional role who identifies him/herself as being young in his/her career.</em>

        Women Connect Everywhere</h2>
        <p>
        Because AFL is a company that champions diversity, we want to celebrate women who choose to pursue careers in manufacturing and the difference they make to our workforce. WeConnect is a community group uniting women at AFL who aim to foster professional education, personal growth and enrichment opportunities via continuous learning, sharing, and networking. Our AFL WeConnect Community aspires to accomplish the following objectives to combat this reality:</p>
        <ul>
