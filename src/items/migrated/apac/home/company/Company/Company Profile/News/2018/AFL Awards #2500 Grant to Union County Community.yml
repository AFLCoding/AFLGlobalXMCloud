        “It is our intent to help very low income people attain a place of stability in which they can propel their lives out of a survival mentality to a pathway to stability, even prosperity—now and generationally,” said Kathy Bragg, CEO of Union County Community Shelter (UCCS). “We have great community support, a strong volunteer presence and a mission that others wish to support.”<br />
         <br />
        <a href="https://www.unionshelter.org/">Union County Community Shelter</a> exists to serve homeless men, women and children in Union County, and also anyone in Union County experiencing a food hardship. UCCS assists people in poverty who are experiencing homelessness by providing emergency shelter and a rapid rehousing program. The shelter promotes a pathway to self-sufficiency which includes income stabilization and permanent housing.<br />
         <br />
        Bragg continued, “We are striving to put an end to episodic homelessness before it turns chronic.”<br />
         <br />
        The shelter cares for those with food security needs by providing meals three times a day, seven days a week through their soup kitchen and food pantry. After meeting basic needs of food and shelter, the shelter uses a case management “coaching” approach, affordable permanent housing access, and twelve month post housing support access to strive to provide a permanent solution to end homelessness, family instability, and hunger. <br />
