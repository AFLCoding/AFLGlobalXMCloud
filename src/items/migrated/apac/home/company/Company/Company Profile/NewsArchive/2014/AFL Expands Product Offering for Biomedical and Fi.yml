        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> is continuing to advance the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Industries/Medical.aspx">biomedical</a> and <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Industries/Fiber-Optic-Component-and-Equipment-Mfg.aspx">fiber laser</a> markets by addressing the need for photonic technologies, early-stage product development and high-volume manufacturing. With 30 years of experience in fiber optic technology, AFL’s products including the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/LAZERMaster-LZM-100-Laser-Splicing-System.aspx">LAZERMaster™</a>, <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/ARCMaster_FSM-100M_and_FSM-100P_Fusion_Splicers.aspx">ARCMaster®</a> series of fusion splicers plus <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment.aspx">accessories</a>, and its <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Solutions/Splicing-and-testing.aspx">engineering services</a> combine to bring best-in-class technology and design concepts forward.</p>
        <p>Developed and manufactured by AFL in conjunction with Fujikura Japan, AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/LAZERMaster-LZM-100-Laser-Splicing-System.aspx">LZM-100 LAZERMaster™</a> is the first commercially available glass processing and splicing system that uses a CO2 laser heat source to perform splicing, adiabatic tapering, ball lensing, and other glass-shaping operations. The LZM possesses large diameter capabilities up to 2.3 mm and long tapering capabilities up to 150 mm. With the clean, deposit-free fiber surface, the LZM-100 provides consistent results essential in biomedical and high power delivery systems.</p>
        <p>Whether splicing similar fiber types or double clad LDF fibers for high power lasers, the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/ARCMaster_FSM-100M_and_FSM-100P_Fusion_Splicers.aspx">ARCMaster</a> series of splicers provide multiple solutions. With State of the ARC® technology, the ARCMaster consists of a patent-pending “split v-groove” fiber clamping system that accommodates optical fiber ranges from 60 to 2000 µm for cladding or coating without changing v-grooves or fiber clamps. The “Plasma Zone” fiber positioning system incorporates multiple fiber and electrode positioning techniques to provide unprecedented versatility for splicing LDF, heat sensitive or small diameter fibers.<br />
        <br />
        AFL also provides custom <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Solutions/Splicing-and-testing.aspx">engineering services</a> for special splicing or fiber preparation applications including custom hardware or software design, process improvement consultation, advanced splicer training and maintenance service agreements. AFL also fabricates spliced components including dissimilar fiber splicing, ball lens, tapers, TEC, combiners and MFAs.</p>
        <p>With vertically integrated operations and manufacturing capabilities, AFL can meet evolving customer requirements in highly technical markets. For more information on AFL, its products and services, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
