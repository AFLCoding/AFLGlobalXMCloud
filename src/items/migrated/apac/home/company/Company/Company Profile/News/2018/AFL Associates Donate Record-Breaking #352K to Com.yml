        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a global manufacturer and provider of services, held its 2nd annual giving campaign, engaging associates within their communities to understand the need and encourage giving back. The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E4E2803881E7472E8F43A3451FDD6B90&_z=z">“Imagine That!” annual campaign</a> supports associates’ financial donations to organizations in the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico and New Zealand—locations where AFL has operations. This year’s campaign resulted in a 21 percent increase over the previous year’s campaign with more than $352,000 given back to organizations worldwide.<br />
        <br />
        “This year’s campaign demonstrates that our associates live our core value of “Community Engagement,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “AFL associates are exceptionally generous and their compassion is making a difference for children and families worldwide.”<br />
        <br />
        This year’s campaign theme was “Lights. Camera. Take Action.” Associates heard from representatives from various organizations in their communities and learned about the need for support. Through AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>, donations were matched dollar-for-dollar up to $100 and for those new to the annual campaign, donations were matched dollar-for-dollar with no limit.  <br />
        <br />
        AFL US locations in South Carolina, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Washington supported local United Way organizations and generated $325,000. AFL locations internationally also supported the annual campaign, donating to various local organizations chosen by associates, and increased the financial impact to $352,000+.<br />
        <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more.
