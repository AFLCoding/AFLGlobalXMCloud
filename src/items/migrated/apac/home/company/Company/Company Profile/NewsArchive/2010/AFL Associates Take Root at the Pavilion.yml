        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;">Spartanburg, SC – On Saturday, November 13, over 30 AFL associates and family members joined together at the Pavilion in Greenville County to plant trees in recognition of Arbor Day in South Carolina, beginning a week-long initiative to give back to the community. This event kicked off AFL's annual Worldwide Week of Community Service where associates around the globe engage in their surrounding communities.<br />
        <br />
        In conjunction with the Greenville County Recreation District (GCRD), AFL Spartanburg volunteers planted 15 trees on the grounds of the Pavilion around the new inclusive playground and the tennis courts. This volunteer project is part of AFL's Take Root tree program which supports tree plantings internationally. AFL has a goal to plant 5,000 trees by the year 2010 and expects to exceed that goal this year.<br />
        <br />
        "AFL's Take Root program focuses on engaging associates and their families to work together and positively affecting our environment while beautifying the landscape," said Corie Culp, Community Relations Manager for AFL. "This is the third year in a row that we've partnered with the Greenville County Recreation District. We appreciate their commitment to support our initiative and provide the time and energy to assist with this project."<br />
        <br />
        In addition to planting trees, volunteers painted the breaker and light boxes, painted new lines in the parking area, and cleaned the Bounce House at the Pavilion, one of Greenville's premier indoor and outdoor sports and recreation facilities.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to this project, AFL associates will support a food drive for the Rescue Mission in Greenville and assist the Ellen Hines Smith Girls' Home in Spartanburg this week. AFL's community program is diverse and includes grants, sponsorships and employee engagement projects. For additional information, visit www.aflglobal.com.<br />
