        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> associates in Atlanta donated $6,500 to <a href="http://www.unitedwayatlanta.org/">United Way of Greater Atlanta</a>. This year’s one-week campaign was more personal and focused on educating associates about the need in the community. Themed “United in Caring—Paint a Brighter Tomorrow,” the campaign raised awareness of where funding goes.<br />
        <br />
        “One of AFL’s core values is community,” commented Mike Booth, president of services for AFL. “We want to help others in our community with a hand up and through this campaign we believe we will have a positive effect on the lives of families.” <br />
        <br />
        The campaign kicked off with a lunch for associates and presentation from Swetha Gupta, engagement director for United Way of Gwinnett County. Additionally, Quintasha Swanson, a graduate of the Way to Work Program with Families First, spoke about how United Way and the funding they receive impacted her family’s life.<br />
        <br />
        The campaign culminated with a service day when associates gathered to paint ceramic tiles that were donated to Good Samaritan, United Way’s local health clinic partner, to brighten up the health clinic. Good Samaritan fills a huge health need in Gwinnett County by providing affordable and quality healthcare services to the homeless and uninsured.<br />
        <br />
        Four additional AFL locations participated in this year’s United Way campaign including Spartanburg, SC, Belmont, NH, Lowell, MA, and Tukwila, WA. All AFL locations that participated generated $196,000 for United Way. <br />
