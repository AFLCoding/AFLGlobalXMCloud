        <div>Spartanburg, SC&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, announces it has entered into a multi-year partnership with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.greenvilletriumph.com/">Greenville Triumph</a>, the Upstate&rsquo;s own United Soccer League (USL) League One team. The partnership includes a co-branded initiative called the "Pass It On Program" which will provide mentoring to underserved and disadvantaged youth players in the Upstate community.<br />
        &ldquo;Partnering with the Greenville Triumph allows us to continue our investment in the Upstate and strengthen our commitment to Community Engagement,&rdquo; explained Jody Gallagher, President and CEO of AFL. &ldquo;AFL and the Greenville Triumph have a common objective&mdash;to engage youth by providing opportunities for their immediate and long-term development. Through the 'Pass It On Program,' youth in the Upstate will have a chance to learn and grow in a positive environment with mentors by their side.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        The "Pass It On Program" is a 60-minute program session that provides participants the opportunity to learn about nutrition, physical activity and life skills in a safe, stress-free environment. Additionally, children will learn about teamwork while working on soccer skills, and at the end of the program, they will participate in a scrimmage. The program will begin May 2021 and will be held once per month, ending September 2021 during the first season. AFL is providing scholarships to be used to support eligible&nbsp;players who would like to attend the Triumph&nbsp;camps and clinics.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Greenville Triumph SC plays its first match as the defending title-winners against the Richmond Kickers at City Stadium on Saturday, April 24. During&nbsp;the league's first full month of action, Greenville will host a matchup&nbsp;between the league&rsquo;s first two title-winners when North Texas comes to Triumph Stadium on May 1.&nbsp;<br />
