        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a global manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, and <a href="http://www.ctcglobal.com/">CTC Global</a>, a manufacturer of conductor core, introduces <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Compression-Accessories/ACCC-HiTemp-Compression-Two-Die-System.aspx">HiTemp® compression accessories for use on ACCC®</a> (Aluminum Conductor Composite Core) conductors.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Compression-Accessories/ACCC-HiTemp-Compression-Two-Die-System.aspx">HiTemp accessories</a> are designed and engineered to operate 25-30 percent cooler than the conductor, improving heat dissipation. These accessories are fabricated from a specially tempered aluminum that transfers elevated current and dissipates increased heat more efficiently. The compression high tension fittings use a unique patented technology designed to hold at least 95 percent of the rated conductor breaking strength without compromising the integrity of the composite conductor core.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://www.ctcglobal.com/products/accc-conductors/">ACCC conductors</a> are a high-capacity, low-sag conductor that utilizes a hybrid carbon and glass fiber core that offers greater strength, a lower coefficient of thermal expansion, lighter weight and excellent corrosion resistance. ACCC conductor offers twice the capacity while cutting line loss by 25-40 percent under equal load conditions.<br />
        <br />
        “As demand increases for power, greater electrical loads are put on existing lines that are unable to handle that load,” commented Gary Harter, commercial manager for AFL’s accessories division. “ACCC conductor carries up to twice the current of conventional ACSR conductor. So rather than building new transmission lines, ACCC conductors can replace existing ACSR conductors to increase energy output.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s HiTemp product line consists of compression and motion control accessories, pulling grips and high temperature compounds as a solution to installing this new technology.<br />
        <br />
        Dave Bryant, director of technology at CTC Global added, “As demand for ACCC conductor has increased exponentially over the last several years, CTC is very pleased to be able to offer AFL’s high performance HiTemp hardware and accessory solutions to our growing customer base.”<br />
