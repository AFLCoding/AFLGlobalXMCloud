        <div>Spartanburg, SC – June 11, 2019 – <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.aflglobal.com/" target="_blank">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, is introducing two fiber optic cleavers to its portfolio. Featuring Bluetooth® technology, the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1ABF0545D8F7429297D36464F1AE403F&_z=z">CT52 Fiber Cleaver</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3F49CDB1EA6849FCBFAB5FBE7563A778&_z=z">CT58 Fiber Cleaver</a> are both designed for use with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=55E85DE502FD4DF7A029245253934A91&_z=z">Fujikura fusion splicing systems</a>.  <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The Fujikura CT52 cleaver supports single fiber cleaving for fibers with a coating diameter of  150 µm to 900 µm, while the Fujikura CT58 cleaver is designed for cleaving silica fibers with 80 µm cladding and up to 400 µm coatings. Both models use a Bluetooth connection and smartphone app that helps manage cleaver blade life. With a motorized push-button blade rotation and a thumbwheel for blade height adjustments, blade life is extended. The 16-position blade yields 60,000 cleaves.<br />
        <br />
        Both cleavers are designed for use with either the Fujikura FH-100 or FH-70 series fiber holders, but also can be used with an adapter plate, eliminating the fiber holders altogether. When the CT52 or CT58 is used with optional spacers for the cleaver and RS-series thermal stripper, six different cleave lengths can be attained. <br />
        <br />
        The Splice+ smartphone application works in cooperation with Bluetooth-enabled Fujikura splicers, cleavers and ribbon fiber strippers. Download the Splice+ app from the Apple App store or at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fujikura.splice_plus_a&hl=en_US">Google Play</a>.<br />
        <br />
