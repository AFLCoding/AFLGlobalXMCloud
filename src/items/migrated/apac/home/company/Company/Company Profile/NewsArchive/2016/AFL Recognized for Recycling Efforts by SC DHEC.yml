        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a>, a leading global fiber optics manufacturer and service provider, was the recipient of the <a href="http://www.scdhec.gov/">South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control</a>’s Smart Business Recycling and Green Hospitality Program which recognizes outstanding waste reduction and recycling efforts. During AFL’s 2015 fiscal year, more than 791 tons of material was recycled, reducing <a href="/Company/Environment-Health-and-Safety/Environmental-Sustainability">the company’s overall environmental impact</a>.<br />
        <br />
        “Responsible management of all the environmental aspects of our operation is one of AFL’s core values and recycling is a big part of this initiative,” commented Don Heatherly, EHS Manager for AFL. “We are highly aware of the impact we could have and strive to make every effort to reduce, reuse and recycle our waste for the benefit of our community.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL focuses on environmental stewardship to achieve business goals. These efforts have expanded over the past 30+ years AFL has been in the upstate of South Carolina. Achievements include a 14 percent reduction in global electricity use; 42 percent reduction in natural gas consumption and 11 percent reduction of water use since 2007. Additionally, all AFL facilities are ISO 14001 certified.<br />
        <br />
        Heatherly added, “All associates are engaged in continuous improvement. We share a commitment to improve upon operations daily for future generations that work and live in and around our operations.”<br />
