Minimal customer downtime and 100% customer satisfaction are the goals of every utility and a proper communications network is essential in reaching these goals.</div>
        <div>AFL developed a "universal groove" design to accommodate a wide range of conductors that achieves the desired low electrical resistance for each conductor size. AFL&rsquo;s parallel grove clamps are designed to accept wide range of conductors to minimize number of clamps needed to cover from No. 8 AWG to 1750 MCM conductors.<br />
        <br />
        Aluminum bolts are used in parallel groove clamps and have an alumilite 205 finish and a thin coating of inhibitor compound to reduce thread friction, provide greater clamping force on the conductor for a given torque. These bolts will not seize. Benefits of aluminum bolts also include equalized expansion and contraction and contraction with temperature changes and favorable modulus of elasticity for &ldquo;spring follow-up.&rdquo;</div>

Minimal customer downtime and 100% customer satisfaction are the goals of every utility and a proper communications network is essential in reaching these goals.</div>
        <div>AFL developed a "universal groove" design to accommodate a wide range of conductors that achieves the desired low electrical resistance for each conductor size. AFL&rsquo;s parallel grove clamps are designed to accept wide range of conductors to minimize number of clamps needed to cover from No. 8 AWG to 1750 MCM conductors.<br />
        <br />
        Aluminum bolts are used in parallel groove clamps and have an alumilite 205 finish and a thin coating of inhibitor compound to reduce thread friction, provide greater clamping force on the conductor for a given torque. These bolts will not seize. Benefits of aluminum bolts also include equalized expansion and contraction and contraction with temperature changes and favorable modulus of elasticity for &ldquo;spring follow-up.&rdquo;</div>
