        <div style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;">Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">AFL</a>, a global manufacturer and provider of services, held its fourth annual <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E4E2803881E7472E8F43A3451FDD6B90&_z=z">Imagine That! fundraising campaign</a>, supporting communities worldwide in areas where AFL has operations. This year’s campaign culminated with a $494,000 donation to organizations around the world including in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Mexico.<br />
        <br />
        This year’s campaign theme was aptly named, “Stronger Together!” Each AFL location conducted a campaign, encouraging associates to consider financially contributing to their community. The campaign was conducted virtually at all locations due to the pandemic, yet still yielded excellent results. All donations were matched dollar for dollar up to $100 by AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>.<br />
         <br />
        Within the United States, AFL partners with United Way chapters to run this campaign, and allow associates to give to United Way or direct designate to an agency of choice. Internationally, AFL locations select partners well-known by associates. This year, international recipients included:<br />
         <br />
        Breakfast Club of Canada<br />
        Prospect Hospice, Headway Swindon, Threshold Housing Link (Swindon, UK)<br />
        Willen Hospice, YMCA, Medical Detection Dogs (Milton Keynes, UK)<br />
        Cantina Nest (Germany)<br />
        VIFAC, CORDEM (Mexico)<br />
        Heart Futures, OzHarvest, Be Someone for Someone (Australia/New Zealand)<br />
         <br />

        <div style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;">Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">AFL</a>, a global manufacturer and provider of services, held its fourth annual <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E4E2803881E7472E8F43A3451FDD6B90&_z=z">Imagine That! fundraising campaign</a>, supporting communities worldwide in areas where AFL has operations. This year’s campaign culminated with a $494,000 donation to organizations around the world including in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Mexico.<br />
        <br />
        This year’s campaign theme was aptly named, “Stronger Together!” Each AFL location conducted a campaign, encouraging associates to consider financially contributing to their community. The campaign was conducted virtually at all locations due to the pandemic, yet still yielded excellent results. All donations were matched dollar for dollar up to $100 by AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>.<br />
         <br />
        Within the United States, AFL partners with United Way chapters to run this campaign, and allow associates to give to United Way or direct designate to an agency of choice. Internationally, AFL locations select partners well-known by associates. This year, international recipients included:<br />
         <br />
        Breakfast Club of Canada<br />
        Prospect Hospice, Headway Swindon, Threshold Housing Link (Swindon, UK)<br />
        Willen Hospice, YMCA, Medical Detection Dogs (Milton Keynes, UK)<br />
        Cantina Nest (Germany)<br />
        VIFAC, CORDEM (Mexico)<br />
