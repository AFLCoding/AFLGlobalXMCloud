        <p>Swindon, UK and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fibre optic cable and accessories and provider of services, nominated <a href="http://www.wiltshireairambulance.co.uk/">Wiltshire Air Ambulance</a> as 2014 Charity of the Year. The announcement comes during a visit to Wiltshire Air Ambulance’s Air Support Unit in Devizes, UK where AFL associates presented a grant for £1000 made possible by AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>. The grant supports the purchase of three Go-Pro® Hero digital cameras for use by crew during helicopter rescue missions.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL surveyed our associates to determine which charities they would like us to support—the most popular response by far was Wiltshire Air Ambulance,” said Jo Lawrence, Sales and Marketing Coordinator at AFL. “We were delighted to provide an AFL Community Outreach grant but we wanted to do more. By naming Wiltshire Air Ambulance as our Charity of the Year, our associates will be more engaged with our community and active in fundraising activities to support the organisation.”<br />
        <br />
        Wiltshire Air Ambulance provides essential helicopter emergency medical service to a population of 684,000 throughout the county of Wiltshire and Swindon. The charity does not receive any government funding and relies totally on the generosity of the public and local businesses to keep this life saving service operational.<br />
        <br />
        “Alongside the vital lifesaving equipment that the crew carry on board the helicopter is a digital camera which captures vital images at the scene of an accident,” stated Karen Gambrell, Trust and Foundations Fundraiser for Wiltshire Air Ambulance. “These photos can provide key information to the medical team when the patient reaches the hospital or if a criminal offence has taken place.”<br />
        <br />
        Later this year, Wiltshire Air Ambulance will take delivery of a new helicopter when its current partnership with Wiltshire Police comes to an end. It will then cost £2.5million a year or £6,850 per day to keep the air ambulance operational.<br />
        <br />

        <p>Swindon, UK and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fibre optic cable and accessories and provider of services, nominated <a href="http://www.wiltshireairambulance.co.uk/">Wiltshire Air Ambulance</a> as 2014 Charity of the Year. The announcement comes during a visit to Wiltshire Air Ambulance’s Air Support Unit in Devizes, UK where AFL associates presented a grant for £1000 made possible by AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>. The grant supports the purchase of three Go-Pro® Hero digital cameras for use by crew during helicopter rescue missions.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL surveyed our associates to determine which charities they would like us to support—the most popular response by far was Wiltshire Air Ambulance,” said Jo Lawrence, Sales and Marketing Coordinator at AFL. “We were delighted to provide an AFL Community Outreach grant but we wanted to do more. By naming Wiltshire Air Ambulance as our Charity of the Year, our associates will be more engaged with our community and active in fundraising activities to support the organisation.”<br />
        <br />
        Wiltshire Air Ambulance provides essential helicopter emergency medical service to a population of 684,000 throughout the county of Wiltshire and Swindon. The charity does not receive any government funding and relies totally on the generosity of the public and local businesses to keep this life saving service operational.<br />
        <br />
        “Alongside the vital lifesaving equipment that the crew carry on board the helicopter is a digital camera which captures vital images at the scene of an accident,” stated Karen Gambrell, Trust and Foundations Fundraiser for Wiltshire Air Ambulance. “These photos can provide key information to the medical team when the patient reaches the hospital or if a criminal offence has taken place.”<br />
        <br />
        Later this year, Wiltshire Air Ambulance will take delivery of a new helicopter when its current partnership with Wiltshire Police comes to an end. It will then cost £2.5million a year or £6,850 per day to keep the air ambulance operational.<br />
