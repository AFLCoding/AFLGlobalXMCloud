        Swindon, UK and Spartanburg, SC – A team of volunteers from <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fibre optic cable and accessories, spent two afternoons with <a href="http://www.uplandseducationaltrust.org.uk/">Uplands Educational Trust</a> (UET), an organisation that provides learning, working and living opportunities for young people with severe or profound learning difficulties.  Volunteers spent the time at the UET Community Enterprise Centre carrying out manual jobs to improve their outside space. The volunteer effort is called an <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=54B66AA7D20E440A829E3731F31C91D4&_z=z">ACT (AFL Community Team) Project</a> and encourages teams of volunteers to serve in their community.<br />
        <br />
        During the six hour volunteer project, associates lifted and relayed paving slabs and large soft matting play area, constructed a small greenhouse and carried out general tidying of the paved outside area. AFL provided a grant of £1,800 for the materials needed for the maintenance works. The grant was made possible by AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>.<br />
        <br />
        “The building was previously used as a children’s centre and there were drawings and designs in the garden tailored to small children. The young adults who use the centre needed a space to reflect their interests and needs instead.” Said Sarah Howes, Head of Charitable Services, Uplands Community Enterprise Centre. “The AFL team have now rid the area of the children’s decorations and made safe some of the loose paving slabs which mean we can start making the outside space an area our young people want to spend time in.”<br />
                                                                                                                                      <br />
        The Community Enterprise Centre is a recent development for UET set in the heart of Swindon and provides Skills for Life adult day provision, leisure clubs and print and craft enterprises as well as training Café for young people between 11-30 years.<br />

        Swindon, UK and Spartanburg, SC – A team of volunteers from <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fibre optic cable and accessories, spent two afternoons with <a href="http://www.uplandseducationaltrust.org.uk/">Uplands Educational Trust</a> (UET), an organisation that provides learning, working and living opportunities for young people with severe or profound learning difficulties.  Volunteers spent the time at the UET Community Enterprise Centre carrying out manual jobs to improve their outside space. The volunteer effort is called an <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=54B66AA7D20E440A829E3731F31C91D4&_z=z">ACT (AFL Community Team) Project</a> and encourages teams of volunteers to serve in their community.<br />
        <br />
        During the six hour volunteer project, associates lifted and relayed paving slabs and large soft matting play area, constructed a small greenhouse and carried out general tidying of the paved outside area. AFL provided a grant of £1,800 for the materials needed for the maintenance works. The grant was made possible by AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>.<br />
        <br />
        “The building was previously used as a children’s centre and there were drawings and designs in the garden tailored to small children. The young adults who use the centre needed a space to reflect their interests and needs instead.” Said Sarah Howes, Head of Charitable Services, Uplands Community Enterprise Centre. “The AFL team have now rid the area of the children’s decorations and made safe some of the loose paving slabs which mean we can start making the outside space an area our young people want to spend time in.”<br />
                                                                                                                                      <br />
        The Community Enterprise Centre is a recent development for UET set in the heart of Swindon and provides Skills for Life adult day provision, leisure clubs and print and craft enterprises as well as training Café for young people between 11-30 years.<br />
         <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more.
