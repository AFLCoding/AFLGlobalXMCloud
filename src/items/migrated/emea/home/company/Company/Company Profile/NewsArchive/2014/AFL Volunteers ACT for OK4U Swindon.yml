        Swindon, UK and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> volunteers gathered at the <a href="http://www.seqol.org/">SEQOL</a>, an organisation that provides quality care and support for adults in Swindon and the surrounding area, to install and plant raised flower beds for <a href="http://www.seqol.org/CareAndSupport/Day-Services/OK4U.aspx">OK4U</a>, a day centre for people with learning and physical disabilities. The project is part of AFL’s Month of Service that is being celebrated throughout the month of April—30 days of service to commemorate AFL’s 30-year anniversary.<br />
        <br />
        Known as an ACT (AFL Community Team) project, associates join together to provide sweat equity and give back to their community. At the end of the service project, AFL volunteers presented a £1,800 grant to the nonprofit organisation. The grant and ACT project are made possible by AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>.<br />
        <br />
        “The people we support are limited in the range of work they are able to take part in. Help and support in developing the gardens is key to the health and well-being of everyone who attends OK4U,” said Jacky Pike, service manager at OK4U. “With the garden development, we are able to support people to take part in the upkeep of the garden, learn new skills to progress onto work opportunities or to be able to look after and develop their own garden areas.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s grant covers the cost of the materials for the raised beds, top soil and plants and other garden materials needed within the grounds. The raised gardens will ensure that everyone supported by the centre will be able to gain access to gardening activities.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Community Outreach Program was created in response to the growing need for support in our communities and the desire to make a difference. The program consists of grants, employee engagement projects, tree planting initiatives and more.<br />

        “The people we support are limited in the range of work they are able to take part in. Help and support in developing the gardens is key to the health and well-being of everyone who attends OK4U,” said Jacky Pike, service manager at OK4U. “With the garden development, we are able to support people to take part in the upkeep of the garden, learn new skills to progress onto work opportunities or to be able to look after and develop their own garden areas.”<br />

        AFL’s grant covers the cost of the materials for the raised beds, top soil and plants and other garden materials needed within the grounds. The raised gardens will ensure that everyone supported by the centre will be able to gain access to gardening activities.<br />

        AFL’s Community Outreach Program was created in response to the growing need for support in our communities and the desire to make a difference. The program consists of grants, employee engagement projects, tree planting initiatives and more.<br />
