        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="/">AFL</a> introduces the <a href="/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers-Ribbon-Fiber/Fujikura-70R-Fusion-Splicer ">Fujikura 70R fusion splicer</a>, the newest addition to Fujikura’s proven <a href="/Products/Fusion-Splicing ">line of splicing products</a>. With the 70R, Fujikura has again set a new standard delivering even faster, more precise splicing results while retaining all of the features and reliability that made its predecessor, the 60R, the premier product for ribbon splicing applications.<br />
        <br />
        The Fujikura 70R fusion splicer offers several enhanced features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p>Automated wind protector and tube heater with the world’s fastest heating time of 40 seconds for a ribbon protection sleeve</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Long-life electrodes provide 1,500 splices</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>High resolution, 4.7-inch color LCD monitor with 90X fiber magnification for improved visibility in low-light  conditions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Configurable automation allows the user to customize the automated functions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Powerful Li-ion battery supports 110 splices and heating cycles with each full charge</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>World’s first six-direction drop-proof design with fully ruggedized rubber casing</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Dust- and rain-proof design provides superior protection</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Innovative transit case design with detachable, built-in worktable</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Video guides for operation and troubleshooting incorporated into the splicer software</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Fully compatible with the <a href="/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Connectors-and-Accessories/Field-Installable-Connectors ">FuseConnect</a> line of splice-on connectors</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>“The 70R builds on the excellent track record set by the 60R. With the automated wind protector and tube heater, quality splicing is even faster. The tube heater clamps the splice protection sleeve from both sides, resulting in a shrink time of an impressive 40 seconds,” commented Greg Pickeral, product manager, fusion splicing systems for AFL.<br />
        <br />
        In 2013, Fujikura is releasing several new products. Earlier this year, the 12S and 12R were introduced, along with the 70S. Fujikura will also soon add the 19S, a fixed V-groove single fiber fusion splicer and the 19R four-fiber ribbon fusion splicer.<br />
        <br />
        Fujikura understands that service and support are just as important as excellent engineering. Like all Fujikura products, the 70R is supported by the most knowledgeable and responsive service team in the industry. While engineering innovation and quality products have made Fujikura a premier provider of fusion splicers, unparalleled levels of service and support are what have made Fujikura the leader in the industry.<br />

        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="/">AFL</a> introduces the <a href="/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers-Ribbon-Fiber/Fujikura-70R-Fusion-Splicer ">Fujikura 70R fusion splicer</a>, the newest addition to Fujikura’s proven <a href="/Products/Fusion-Splicing ">line of splicing products</a>. With the 70R, Fujikura has again set a new standard delivering even faster, more precise splicing results while retaining all of the features and reliability that made its predecessor, the 60R, the premier product for ribbon splicing applications.<br />
        <br />
        The Fujikura 70R fusion splicer offers several enhanced features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p>Automated wind protector and tube heater with the world’s fastest heating time of 40 seconds for a ribbon protection sleeve</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Long-life electrodes provide 1,500 splices</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>High resolution, 4.7-inch color LCD monitor with 90X fiber magnification for improved visibility in low-light  conditions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Configurable automation allows the user to customize the automated functions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Powerful Li-ion battery supports 110 splices and heating cycles with each full charge</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>World’s first six-direction drop-proof design with fully ruggedized rubber casing</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Dust- and rain-proof design provides superior protection</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Innovative transit case design with detachable, built-in worktable</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Video guides for operation and troubleshooting incorporated into the splicer software</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Fully compatible with the <a href="/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Connectors-and-Accessories/Field-Installable-Connectors ">FuseConnect</a> line of splice-on connectors</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>“The 70R builds on the excellent track record set by the 60R. With the automated wind protector and tube heater, quality splicing is even faster. The tube heater clamps the splice protection sleeve from both sides, resulting in a shrink time of an impressive 40 seconds,” commented Greg Pickeral, product manager, fusion splicing systems for AFL.<br />
        <br />
        In 2013, Fujikura is releasing several new products. Earlier this year, the 12S and 12R were introduced, along with the 70S. Fujikura will also soon add the 19S, a fixed V-groove single fiber fusion splicer and the 19R four-fiber ribbon fusion splicer.<br />
        <br />
        Fujikura understands that service and support are just as important as excellent engineering. Like all Fujikura products, the 70R is supported by the most knowledgeable and responsive service team in the industry. While engineering innovation and quality products have made Fujikura a premier provider of fusion splicers, unparalleled levels of service and support are what have made Fujikura the leader in the industry.<br />
