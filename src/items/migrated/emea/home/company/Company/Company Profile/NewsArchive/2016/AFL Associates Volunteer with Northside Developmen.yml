        Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /">AFL</a> associates volunteered time with the <a href="http://www.spartanburgndg.com/">Northside Development Group</a> (NDG) in Spartanburg, SC to support the repair of several homes and continue the revitalization efforts of this area. Known as an <a href=" /Company/Community/ACT-Project ">ACT</a> (AFL Community Team) project, nearly 25 associates from AFL’s accessories division served this community by completing the build of a wheelchair ramp, pressure washing homes and painting rooms.  <br />
        <br />
        “Each time we volunteer we gain a greater understanding of the organization, our community and the needs in the community,” commented Eric Borowicz, general manager for AFL’s accessories division. “With the Northside initiative in full swing, we’re proud to have made an impact that will improve the lives of homeowners.”<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="http://www.spartanburgndg.com/">Northside Development Group</a> is managing the redevelopment of the City of Spartanburg’s Northside community by expanding the economic, educational, recreational health and social opportunities for its residents. Several projects are on the horizon within NDG including the daylighting of Butterfly Creek, the construction of the early childhood community center and the new Dr. T.K. Gregg Community Center.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL’s Community Advisory Board has kept us well-informed of the Northside initiative and we are excited to partner with them by providing volunteers needed for ongoing projects,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “As this area develops, AFL plans to continue supporting NDG’s efforts for current residents and future generations.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s <a href=" /Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a> not only supports employee volunteerism but also includes grants, scholarships, associate engagement projects, conservation initiatives and more.

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /">AFL</a> associates volunteered time with the <a href="http://www.spartanburgndg.com/">Northside Development Group</a> (NDG) in Spartanburg, SC to support the repair of several homes and continue the revitalization efforts of this area. Known as an <a href=" /Company/Community/ACT-Project ">ACT</a> (AFL Community Team) project, nearly 25 associates from AFL’s accessories division served this community by completing the build of a wheelchair ramp, pressure washing homes and painting rooms.  <br />
        <br />
        “Each time we volunteer we gain a greater understanding of the organization, our community and the needs in the community,” commented Eric Borowicz, general manager for AFL’s accessories division. “With the Northside initiative in full swing, we’re proud to have made an impact that will improve the lives of homeowners.”<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="http://www.spartanburgndg.com/">Northside Development Group</a> is managing the redevelopment of the City of Spartanburg’s Northside community by expanding the economic, educational, recreational health and social opportunities for its residents. Several projects are on the horizon within NDG including the daylighting of Butterfly Creek, the construction of the early childhood community center and the new Dr. T.K. Gregg Community Center.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL’s Community Advisory Board has kept us well-informed of the Northside initiative and we are excited to partner with them by providing volunteers needed for ongoing projects,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “As this area develops, AFL plans to continue supporting NDG’s efforts for current residents and future generations.”<br />
        <br />
