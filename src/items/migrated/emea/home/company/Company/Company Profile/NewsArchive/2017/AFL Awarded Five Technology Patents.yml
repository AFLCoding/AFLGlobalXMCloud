        Spartanburg, SC – Several <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> associates were recognized for receiving patent awards for developing new products and technologies within the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant.aspx">optical connectivity</a>, <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment.aspx">fusion splicing</a> and <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection.aspx">test and inspection</a> divisions.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Test & Inspection team received a patent for the Health Meter interface on the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/xWDM-Test/WDM900-Lightwave-Test-Set.aspx">WDM900 Lightwave Test Set</a> product line. Through this innovative user experience, the traditional complexity of an optical spectrum analyzer is simplified by combining multiple parameters into a single diagnosis of healthy or unhealthy for all channels in a C/DWDM transmission system. This enables the general user to quickly and easily collect expert-level test results in the field.<br />
        <br />
        The Optical Connectivity Team received two patents for subsea hardware. The first patent is for a highly reliable, full ocean pressure “tube seal” consisting of a swage and a Morrison seal. The second patent, “cylindrical housing with locking ring” describes a one atmosphere pressuring housing designed to interconnect small subsea cables. Both inventions complement AFL’s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Subsea.aspx">subsea cable product portfolio</a>.<br />
        <br />
        Finally, AFL’s harsh environment team received a patent for new cable technology which enables optical fiber to be deployed as a temperature sensor in extremely high temperature environments in hydrocarbon processing and geothermal applications.<br />
