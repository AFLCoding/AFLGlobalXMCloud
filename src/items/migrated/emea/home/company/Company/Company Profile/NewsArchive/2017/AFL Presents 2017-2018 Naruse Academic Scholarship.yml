        <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> announces it awarded the 2017-2018 <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=19332D89F65248E08A271CAFF52B718D&_z=z">Naruse Academic Scholarship Award</a> to Kelsey Mercurio, daughter of Joseph Mercurio, software engineer with AFL’s test and inspection division in Lowell, Massachusetts. The Scholarship recognizes academic achievement, community service and leadership.<br />
        <br />
        Having graduated with 4.54 GPA, Kelsey plans to major in biochemistry as applied to agriculture. Her interest in the sciences developed over time as she enjoyed more rigorous classes in high school such as biology and chemistry. Her background in serving alongside others at soup kitchens and her church community helped drive her interest even more. Kelsey’s long-term goals include working directly with farmers in developing countries to find ways to increase food production and sustainability.<br />
        <br />
        “I want to research solutions and innovative ways to increase food production and sustainability without damaging the environment, without using pesticides,” commented Kelsey.<br />
        <br />
        While in high school, Kelsey ran cross country and wrote a high school play. Additionally, she enjoys singing and dancing. Kelsey has been very involved with community service with her school and church, having taken various trips to serve others. “I really like the times I get to interact with the people that come in,” she continued.<br />
        <br />
        Kelsey will attend the University of New Hampshire, College of Life Sciences and Agriculture in the fall.<br />
        <br />
        Each year, AFL awards a four-year scholarship to the son or daughter of a North American-based AFL associate entering a college or university. The scholarship was named in memory of Toshihide Naruse, Managing Director of Fujikura, AFL’s parent company. Mr. Naruse’s contributions to AFL were significant, and because of his personal interest in higher education, AFL continues to honor his memory.<br />
