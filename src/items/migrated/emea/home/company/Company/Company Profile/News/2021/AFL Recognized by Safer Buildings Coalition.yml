        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading provider of engineering and installation services and manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, is excited to announce that it was recognized by the <a href="https://www.saferbuildings.org/">Safer Buildings Coalition</a> (SBC) as the recipient of the 2021 Safe Inside Project of the Year. SBC’s Safe Inside Project of the Year award recognizes outstanding projects in the in-building public safety communications market. It spotlights projects for their impact, quality of workmanship, innovation, and contribution to reducing noise and interference.<br />
        <br />
        AFL was recognized for a project installation for a large communications carrier at <a href="https://fifthandb.com/">Fifth + Broadway</a> in Nashville, Tennessee. Fifth + Broadway is one of the largest mixed-use venues in the history of Nashville that covers a city block and consists of retail shops, restaurants, a residential tower, class-A office space, a museum, and a large above and below-ground parking structure. AFL provided a full turnkey Emergency Responder Radio Communications System (ERRCS) which provides coverage for first responders in areas where the existing public safety network would not reach.<br />
        <br />
        “With a development of this magnitude—of over one million square feet of public safety coverage—a properly designed and implemented public safety-first responder system is critical,” explained Michael Orendain, Vice President of AFL’s Enterprise Services Optical Telecom Division. “Our solution was deployed in three phases over the course of a year. It was fiber-based and designed to avoid interfering with the existing Nashville Public Safety System.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL worked closely with the City of Nashville Fire Marshall, Site Developer, and General Contractor while navigating the pandemic and an onsite workforce of over 500 workers per day to meet project deadlines and successfully commission the large-scale project.  <br />
        <br />
        “Every member of our team was committed to the success of the Fifth + Broadway project and knew its importance to the City of Nashville and its First Responders. To be recognized by our industry peers and alongside so many other dedicated SBC companies is humbling,” commented Orendain.<br />
        <br />
        The Safe Inside Awards were created to recognize outstanding initiative in the in-building public safety communications market. Categories included the Safe Inside Product of the Year and Safe Inside Project of the Year. Submitted products and projects were required to specifically pertain to the in-building public safety market and demonstrate an innovation that furthers the mission of improving in-building public safety.<br />
        <br />
        “Much deserved congratulations to our Safe Inside Award winners. In the mission to improve in-building public safety communications, the efforts of those across our industry are what drives impactful change. It’s our pleasure as an industry leader to be able to recognize the most impactful, and successful initiatives,” said Safer Buildings Coalition Executive Director, Chief Alan Perdue.<br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading provider of engineering and installation services and manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, is excited to announce that it was recognized by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saferbuildings.org/">Safer Buildings Coalition</a>&nbsp;(SBC) as the recipient of the 2021 Safe Inside Project of the Year. SBC&rsquo;s Safe Inside Project of the Year award recognizes outstanding projects in the in-building public safety communications market. It spotlights projects for their impact, quality of workmanship, innovation, and contribution to reducing noise and interference.<br />
        <br />
        AFL was recognized for a project installation for a large communications carrier at&nbsp;<a href="https://fifthandb.com/">Fifth + Broadway</a>&nbsp;in Nashville, Tennessee. Fifth + Broadway is one of the largest mixed-use venues in the history of Nashville that covers a city block and consists of retail shops, restaurants, a residential tower, class-A office space, a museum, and a large above and below-ground parking structure. AFL provided a full turnkey Emergency Responder Radio Communications System (ERRCS) which provides coverage for first responders in areas where the existing public safety network would not reach.<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;With a development of this magnitude&mdash;of over one million square feet of public safety coverage&mdash;a properly designed and implemented public safety-first responder system is critical,&rdquo; explained Michael Orendain, Vice President of AFL&rsquo;s Enterprise Services Optical Telecom Division. &ldquo;Our solution was deployed in three phases over the course of a year. It was fiber-based and designed to avoid interfering with the existing Nashville Public Safety System.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        AFL worked closely with the City of Nashville Fire Marshall, Site Developer, and General Contractor while navigating the pandemic and an onsite workforce of over 500 workers per day to meet project deadlines and successfully commission the large-scale project. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;Every member of our team was committed to the success of the Fifth + Broadway project and knew its importance to the City of Nashville and its First Responders. To be recognized by our industry peers and alongside so many other dedicated SBC companies is humbling,&rdquo; commented Orendain.<br />
        <br />
        The Safe Inside Awards were created to recognize outstanding initiative in the in-building public safety communications market. Categories included the Safe Inside Product of the Year and Safe Inside Project of the Year. Submitted products and projects were required to specifically pertain to the in-building public safety market and demonstrate an innovation that furthers the mission of improving in-building public safety.<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;Much deserved congratulations to our Safe Inside Award winners. In the mission to improve in-building public safety communications, the efforts of those across our industry are what drives impactful change. It&rsquo;s our pleasure as an industry leader to be able to recognize the most impactful, and successful initiatives,&rdquo; said Safer Buildings Coalition Executive Director, Chief Alan Perdue.<br />
