Through this partnership, Light Brigade will build student confidence by providing trainees with access to the professional level FTTx training necessary to support the region’s telecommunication networks.<br />
         <br />
        “Light Brigade’s <a href="https://www.lightbrigade.com/Training-Courses/FTTx-for-Installers-and-Technicians.aspx">FTTx for Installers and Technicians</a> training program will support the FTTH Council Asia-Pacific’s charter to provide ongoing employability of people working in this industry within the APAC region,” said Dario De Paolis, vice president and general manager of Light Brigade. “Our program ensures that the FTTH skills and qualifications of the region’s associates are consistent and reflect the needs of local telecommunication networks.”<br />
         <br />
        The four-day class provides 16 hours of classroom lecture and 16 hours of hands-on training on the topics of testing splitters, WDM devices, measuring reflectance and bidirectional testing that are unique to FTTx networks.<br />
         <br />
        Established in 2005, the FTTH Council Asia-Pacific is building on the success of its sister organizations in the US and Europe to educate the industry and the general public on the opportunities and benefits of FTTH solutions.
