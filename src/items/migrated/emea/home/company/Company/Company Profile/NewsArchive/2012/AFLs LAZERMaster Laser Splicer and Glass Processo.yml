        <p>AFL’s LZM-100 <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/LAZERMaster-LZM-100-Laser-Splicing-System.aspx">LAZERMaster</a> glass processing and splicing system has been selected as one of three finalists for the <a href="http://www.photonicsprismaward.com/aboutus.aspx">SPIE and Photonics Media Prism Award</a>, an international competition that recognizes companies that develop products to solve problems and improve life through photonics. AFL’s application was entered under the category of manufacturing.<br />
        <br />
        Developed and manufactured by AFL in conjunction with Fujikura Japan, AFL’s LZM-100 LAZERMaster is the first commercially available glass processing and splicing system that uses a CO2 laser heat source to perform splicing, adiabatic tapering and other glass-shaping operations. The LZM possesses large diameter capabilities up to 2.3 mm and long tapering capabilities up to 150 mm.<br />
        <br />
        The LZM-100 patent-pending Laser Power Stability feature allows for cleaner splicing. Typical CO2 lasers have an output power fluctuation of +/- 5 percent which produces inconsistent splicing results and may cause irregularity and ripple in a taper profile. The LZM-100 utilizes closed-loop power stabilization techniques, resulting in an order of magnitude improvement in power stability and enabling highly repeatable processes and smooth taper profiles.<br />
        <br />
        Another unique feature is the Warm Tapering Imaging (WTI) monitoring for precise control of heating power. The WTI brightness level is captured in real time during the tapering process. The WTI value is used to adjust the CO2 laser output power in real time to a level appropriate for the decreasing mass of a fiber as it is tapered to a smaller diameter.<br />
         <br />
        AFL is the first to market a commercially available laser splicer, the LAZERMaster, with unique features such as the CO2 laser heat source and advanced feedback control and stabilization techniques. The LAZERMaster is a unique customized solution that helps decrease costs by improving performance and productivity.

        The LZM-100 patent-pending Laser Power Stability feature allows for cleaner splicing. Typical CO2 lasers have an output power fluctuation of +/- 5 percent which produces inconsistent splicing results and may cause irregularity and ripple in a taper profile. The LZM-100 utilizes closed-loop power stabilization techniques, resulting in an order of magnitude improvement in power stability and enabling highly repeatable processes and smooth taper profiles.<br />
        <br />
        Another unique feature is the Warm Tapering Imaging (WTI) monitoring for precise control of heating power. The WTI brightness level is captured in real time during the tapering process. The WTI value is used to adjust the CO2 laser output power in real time to a level appropriate for the decreasing mass of a fiber as it is tapered to a smaller diameter.<br />
