        <p>Monroe, NC and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> awarded a $5,000 grant to <a href="https://turningpointnc.org/">Turning Point, Inc</a>., an organization that is striving to end domestic abuse, sexual assault and child abuse through safe shelter, advocacy, prevention and social change. The grant will support the <a href="https://turningpointnc.org/domestic-violence/">Domestic Violence Shelter Program</a>, which focuses on shelter expenses and the enhancement of prevention and educational opportunities for both children and adults.</p>
        <div>
        <br />
        “We are profoundly grateful to AFL for their support of our mission,” said Jessie Lindberg, executive director for Turning Point. “Our agency serves thousands of individuals each year and that would simply not be possibly without the generosity of partners like AFL.”<br />
         <br />
        <a href="https://turningpointnc.org/">Turning Point</a> serves domestic violence victims and their children by providing safe shelter, advocacy, prevention and social change. The shelter is a 42-bed facility that is open 24/7, 365 days a year. Through a wide variety of resources, the shelter is able to provide safety and caring support for the victims of domestic violence. Education is provided to adults to learn to become self-sufficient, and to children to assist with any developmental delays that may have occurred due to violence or to teach children how to express their feelings without turning to violence. Turning Point provides the support necessary for victims to become and remain independent and break the cycle of violence that exists in many homes within our community.<br />
         <br />
        “Our goal is that shelter residents learn to recognize the common cycles of abuse, develop safety plans, set and meet goals to become self-sufficient and live violence free in homes of their own,” said Denise Davis, director of Domestic Violence Services. “For families in crisis, the shelter is often the only safe haven from violence, emotional and sexual abuse and even death. By providing shelter and services to domestic violence victims, Turning Point is helping to break the cycle of abuse and helping to prevent homelessness due to domestic violence in the community.”<br />
         <br />
        The grant from AFL will provide funds for shelter supplies, counseling, children’s programs and transportation for clients who do not have transportation of their own.<br />
         <br />
        <a href="https://turningpointnc.org/">Turning Point</a> is the only domestic violence program in Union County, and has been serving the community since 1985. Through their multiple programs, Turning Point is working to see that all people will have safe and healthy relationships in their homes, schools, workplaces, and communities, and will know that “love doesn’t have to hurt”.<br />
         <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more.

        <p>Monroe, NC and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> awarded a $5,000 grant to <a href="https://turningpointnc.org/">Turning Point, Inc</a>., an organization that is striving to end domestic abuse, sexual assault and child abuse through safe shelter, advocacy, prevention and social change. The grant will support the <a href="https://turningpointnc.org/domestic-violence/">Domestic Violence Shelter Program</a>, which focuses on shelter expenses and the enhancement of prevention and educational opportunities for both children and adults.</p>

        <br />
        “We are profoundly grateful to AFL for their support of our mission,” said Jessie Lindberg, executive director for Turning Point. “Our agency serves thousands of individuals each year and that would simply not be possibly without the generosity of partners like AFL.”<br />
         <br />
        <a href="https://turningpointnc.org/">Turning Point</a> serves domestic violence victims and their children by providing safe shelter, advocacy, prevention and social change. The shelter is a 42-bed facility that is open 24/7, 365 days a year. Through a wide variety of resources, the shelter is able to provide safety and caring support for the victims of domestic violence. Education is provided to adults to learn to become self-sufficient, and to children to assist with any developmental delays that may have occurred due to violence or to teach children how to express their feelings without turning to violence. Turning Point provides the support necessary for victims to become and remain independent and break the cycle of violence that exists in many homes within our community.<br />
         <br />
        “Our goal is that shelter residents learn to recognize the common cycles of abuse, develop safety plans, set and meet goals to become self-sufficient and live violence free in homes of their own,” said Denise Davis, director of Domestic Violence Services. “For families in crisis, the shelter is often the only safe haven from violence, emotional and sexual abuse and even death. By providing shelter and services to domestic violence victims, Turning Point is helping to break the cycle of abuse and helping to prevent homelessness due to domestic violence in the community.”<br />
         <br />
        The grant from AFL will provide funds for shelter supplies, counseling, children’s programs and transportation for clients who do not have transportation of their own.<br />
         <br />
        <a href="https://turningpointnc.org/">Turning Point</a> is the only domestic violence program in Union County, and has been serving the community since 1985. Through their multiple programs, Turning Point is working to see that all people will have safe and healthy relationships in their homes, schools, workplaces, and communities, and will know that “love doesn’t have to hurt”.<br />
         <br />
