        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a global leader of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, presented <a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a> with a check for $177,000, an increase of 7 percent over the 2014 campaign. The donation was made possible by AFL associates as well as AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a> which supplemented donations. Themed “United in Caring | Paint a Better Tomorrow,” AFL’s annual United Way campaign set a record for the company with a 12 percent increase in donor participation and 7 percent increase in corporate contribution (associate donations plus corporate donations) over 2014.<br />
        <br />
        “United Way is the foundation for our Community Outreach Program here in the Upstate and around the world where AFL has locations,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “When we partner with United Way, I believe we double our impact. They clearly know where the need is and our donation supplements that need.”<br />
         <br />
        The annual United Way campaign kicked off with an informational breakfast for AFL associates. Fifteen nonprofit agency representatives attended and spoke with AFL associates about their organization and how United Way has impacted them. AFL also created a video that showcased how United Way has impacted four associates that work at AFL.  <br />
        <br />
        The two-week campaign also included two agency fairs, agency tours and various speakers—all aimed at educating associates. Two teams of AFL associates also participated in an <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/ACT-Project.aspx">AFL Community Team (ACT) project</a> by painting the hallway of the <a href="http://www.cancerassociation.org/">Cancer Association of Spartanburg and Cherokee Counties</a> and the inside of a <a href="http://www.habitatgreenville.org/">Habitat for Humanity Greenville</a> home.  <br />
        <br />
        Four additional AFL locations participated in this year’s United Way campaign including Belmont, NH, Lowell, MA, Atlanta, GA and Tukwila, WA. All AFL locations that participated generated $196,000 for United Way.  <br />
        <br />
        Culp continued, “I’m consistently astounded at the generosity of our associates. They continue to show their love for our community—whether through this annual campaign, by volunteering at a nonprofit organization or generously donating non-perishable items. They want to give back.”<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a global leader of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, presented <a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a> with a check for $177,000, an increase of 7 percent over the 2014 campaign. The donation was made possible by AFL associates as well as AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a> which supplemented donations. Themed “United in Caring | Paint a Better Tomorrow,” AFL’s annual United Way campaign set a record for the company with a 12 percent increase in donor participation and 7 percent increase in corporate contribution (associate donations plus corporate donations) over 2014.<br />
        <br />
        “United Way is the foundation for our Community Outreach Program here in the Upstate and around the world where AFL has locations,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “When we partner with United Way, I believe we double our impact. They clearly know where the need is and our donation supplements that need.”<br />
         <br />
        The annual United Way campaign kicked off with an informational breakfast for AFL associates. Fifteen nonprofit agency representatives attended and spoke with AFL associates about their organization and how United Way has impacted them. AFL also created a video that showcased how United Way has impacted four associates that work at AFL.  <br />
        <br />
        The two-week campaign also included two agency fairs, agency tours and various speakers—all aimed at educating associates. Two teams of AFL associates also participated in an <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/ACT-Project.aspx">AFL Community Team (ACT) project</a> by painting the hallway of the <a href="http://www.cancerassociation.org/">Cancer Association of Spartanburg and Cherokee Counties</a> and the inside of a <a href="http://www.habitatgreenville.org/">Habitat for Humanity Greenville</a> home.  <br />
        <br />
        Four additional AFL locations participated in this year’s United Way campaign including Belmont, NH, Lowell, MA, Atlanta, GA and Tukwila, WA. All AFL locations that participated generated $196,000 for United Way.  <br />
        <br />
        Culp continued, “I’m consistently astounded at the generosity of our associates. They continue to show their love for our community—whether through this annual campaign, by volunteering at a nonprofit organization or generously donating non-perishable items. They want to give back.”<br />
