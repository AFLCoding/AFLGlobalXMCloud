        <h1>Why Work with AFL?</h1>
        <p>At AFL, we offer real solutions for our customers. We have built a reputation in the fiber optics industry of consistently being on the forefront of technology and innovation, with a steady focus on engineering and manufacturing new products that will make a positive difference to our customers.</p>
        <p>We know that this does not just happen. It is about having the right people. It is about securing the right talent that comes to work each day ready to make a difference. We also know that prospective associates have a choice in where they choose to work. The team at AFL is growing, so we would like for you to consider a career here with us. What makes AFL unique? What makes AFL a terrific company? What makes AFL a great place to work?</p>
        <h2>A heritage of growth</h2>
        <p>AFL was founded in 1984, and we have been expanding ever since. We have diversified our business in ways that make sense. No singular product dominates our business model, and we combine organic growth with carefully evaluated strategic acquisitions. We do business in 130 countries around the world, with nearly 20 percent of our revenue coming from outside the U.S.</p>
        <h2>Financially sound</h2>
        <p>The balance sheet matters. AFL is proud of our impressive financial performance. Our gross profit and operating margin have remained strong and consistent, and we are making the investments and building the right team to ensure that we continue to grow and nurture our business. AFL is owned by Fujikura, a $7 billion company with a 130-year history of product innovation. We are also the driving force of Fujikura’s telecommunications business in North America and Europe.</p>
        <p>At AFL, not only are we growing our business organically each year, we are acquiring new companies that fit in the AFL family and provide tangible benefits to our customers. Over the last 35 years, AFL has acquired more than 30 companies.</p>
        <h2>A culture of commitment</h2>
        <p>At AFL, our associates are committed to making AFL successful. You will find driven, passionate, very energetic people at AFL. Our associates like being part of a team where new ideas are welcome. Our people are delivering value to our customers and our business every single day. If you’re looking for just a job where you can coast, AFL is not the place.</p>
        <p>While we have a proven and exceptional leadership team, AFL drives decision making down into the organization. We know that the best concepts and processes come from associates on the front lines.</p>
        <p>The nearly 5,800 associates at AFL are at work making things happen for our customers. Also, when properly considered and studied, we know that taking a risk can yield tremendous rewards. At AFL, we’re building and nurturing a culture where each associate is empowered to contribute.</p>
        <p>AFL is committed to making a positive impact in our communities. Our <a href="/Company/Community">Community Outreach Program</a> offers opportunities for associates to participate in a wide range of activities focused on giving back.</p>
        <p>The bottom line is simple. Our culture is all about one thing: enabling each associate to truly make a difference.</p>
        <h2>Growth opportunities</h2>
        <p>At AFL, how far you go is up to you. The <a href="/Company/Company-Profile/Leadership-Team">leadership team</a> at AFL supports movement across various business units and disciplines. Also, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AB8D40F1EA4B440FB80C3E0CECFEA2D3&_z=z">our locations</a> around the world offer multiple <a href="/Company/Careers/Job-Opportunities">career path opportunities</a> in various disciplines: engineering, commercial, sales, manufacturing and a variety of support functions.</p>
