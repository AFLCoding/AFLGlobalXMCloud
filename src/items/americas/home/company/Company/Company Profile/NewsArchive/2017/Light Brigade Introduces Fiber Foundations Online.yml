        <em>Fiber Foundations</em> is self-paced and takes approximately two hours to complete. The easy-to-understand descriptions include helpful examples and animations to reinforce learning. Students will leave with a basic understanding of multimode and single-mode fiber, the terminology used for describing fiber, loss, bandwidth, wavelengths, connectors, cables and many other foundational concepts.<br />
         <br />
        Kellett continued, “Our customers have been asking for something that would help them better prepare for our introductory courses. We built something to help them and to help anyone just starting out in any aspect of the industry.”<br />
