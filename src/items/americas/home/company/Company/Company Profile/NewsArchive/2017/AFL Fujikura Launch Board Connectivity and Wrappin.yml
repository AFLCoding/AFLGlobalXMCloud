        AFL/Fujikura Launch Board Connectivity and Wrapping Tube Cable at OFC 2017
        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, an industry-leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, is exhibiting with Fujikura, its parent company, at the OFC Conference and Exhibition in Los Angeles, March 21–23, Booth #2939. New product introductions include optical <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B1FDA2935446451F93714A0B8B298AE1&_z=z">card edge</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B1FDA2935446451F93714A0B8B298AE1&_z=z">on-card assemblies</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=700FA7F356564DF8AA34C82971BFE193&_z=z">Wrapping Tube Cable with SWR® Technology</a>.</p>
        <p>AFL’s newest product line consists of board level fiber connectivity products that link embedded optical modules to the card edge, blind-mate mid-plane connectors and backplane solutions. Ideal for applications such as server, switch and router line cards, AFL’s card edge solutions are designed for high density and fast interconnect. Standard MT ferrules and expanded beam ferrules are available in MPO connectors and ganged MT connector systems as well as the US Conec MXC® style connector. Additionally, AFL offers a variety of <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Board-Level-Fiber-Connectivity/On-card-Assemblies.aspx">on-card assemblies</a> such as fiber arrays and V-groove assemblies that are directly embedded on the card in the server, router and switch. These assemblies allow for excellent core position accuracy and are customizable for customer specific applications.</p>
        AFL will also showcase the Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC) with SWR®, an ultra-high density fiber optic cable that uses a new ribbon technology called SpiderWeb® (SWR) Ribbon, a bonded fiber ribbon design that allows for either a highly efficient ribbon splicing or an individual fiber breakout splicing process. The cable is available in dielectric or double jacket single armor and in fiber counts from 144 to 1,728. Fully qualified to Telcordia GR-20, WTC is ideal for data center building interconnections, access provider metro rings, service provider FTTx and cable TV subscriber networks.<br />
        <br />
        Additional products to be showcased at OFC include Fujikura’s suite of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=55E85DE502FD4DF7A029245253934A91&_z=z">fusion splicers</a> including specialty fusion splicers, cleavers and accessories. Stop by booth #2939 for demonstrations.<br />

These assemblies allow for excellent core position accuracy and are customizable for customer specific applications.</p>
        AFL will also showcase the Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC) with SWR®, an ultra-high density fiber optic cable that uses a new ribbon technology called SpiderWeb® (SWR) Ribbon, a bonded fiber ribbon design that allows for either a highly efficient ribbon splicing or an individual fiber breakout splicing process. The cable is available in dielectric or double jacket single armor and in fiber counts from 144 to 1,728. Fully qualified to Telcordia GR-20, WTC is ideal for data center building interconnections, access provider metro rings, service provider FTTx and cable TV subscriber networks.<br />
