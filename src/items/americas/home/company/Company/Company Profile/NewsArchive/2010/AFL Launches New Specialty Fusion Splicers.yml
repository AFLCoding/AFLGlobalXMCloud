        Spartanburg, SC - AFL is launching two new fiber optic fusion splicers: the FSM-100M and the FSM-100P for splicing polarization maintaining (PM) fibers. Both new specialty fiber fusion splicers offer a host of innovative technologies to address the rapidly expanding splicing needs for factory, manufacturing, laboratory, and R&D applications. The technologically superior splicing machines incorporate multiple pending patents.<br />
        <br />
        "The 100M and 100P series splicers further position Fujikura as the dominant player in the specialty splicer market. We are proud to offer customers around the world splicing products that are adaptable for a variety of specialty splicing needs, reliable, and consistent in performance, while providing a real value," said Kiyoshi Nakajima, General Manager; Splicer Business at Fujikura. "This new family of splicers is being introduced as the "ARCMaster®" series because of the unique capabilities to control the plasma zone of the fusion arc. These capabilities will revolutionize the way users splice various types of specialty fibers, including LDF, low contrast PM, and holey / micro-structured."<br />
        <br />
        Fujikura's new "ARCMaster®" splicers are engineered with a robust set of features that offer customers technology and reliability not available elsewhere:<br />
        <br />
        Patented "split v-groove" clamping system – accommodates optical fiber ranges from 60µm to 2000µm for cladding or coating without changing v-grooves or fiber clamps.<br />
        <br />
        Dual PM alignment technologies – Called IPA (Interrelation Profile Alignment), this new technology properly aligns and splices the increasing and technically challenging variety of PM fibers. The FSM-100P includes both traditional PAS alignment as well as the new IPA technology, providing users with the most comprehensive capabilities on the market for splicing PM fiber. IPA also enables accurate PER estimation for all PM fiber types.<br />
        <br />
        "Plasma Zone" fiber positioning – "ARCMaster®" splicers incorporate multiple fiber and electrode positioning techniques in order to provide unprecedented versatility for splicing LDF as well as heat sensitive or small diameter fibers.<br />
        <br />
        Special arc calibration technology – facilitates an easy transfer of high end splicing applications from R&D to production by ensuring consistent performance and enables full exploitation of "Plasma Zone" capabilities.<br />
        <br />
        Improved splice loss estimation technology – Combining the best features of both cold and warm splice imaging, these new generation splicers offer unprecedented accuracy for splice loss estimation.<br />
        <br />
        Zero degree fiber holder position – For splicing LDF fibers with minimal core angle, the fiber holders are horizontally positioned relative to the v-grooves thus minimizing higher order modes in double clad fibers. LDF splicing performance is also enhanced by the capability to mount the fiber holders in reversed orientation.<br />
        <br />
        Enhanced sweep arc technology – Increased travel range for "sweep arc" provides improved MFD matching capability and the ability for reshaping non-circular fibers in preparation for splicing.<br />
        <br />
        Production friendly design – A low profile design that eliminates fiber catch points, the dimensions of both splicers are consistent with the most popular production splicing work-benches in use today.<br />
        <br />
        Internet firmware updates – An industry first! Customers can now upgrade firmware as new capabilities become available from Fujikura. Upgrading is as simple as connecting a USB cable to your splicer.<br />
        <br />
        The need for Accurate, Reliable, and Consistent splicing is expanding to new applications beyond telecommunications. Today splicing is used for fiber lasers, sensors, medical applications, and research and development. These new "ARCMaster®" fusion splicers from Fujikura have been developed to provide the ultimate in performance and flexibility for a variety of customers and markets.<br />
        <br />
        Additional information can be found at www.StateoftheARC.com. Stay tuned to www.StateoftheARC.com for forthcoming additions to the "ARCMaster®" family of specialty fusion splicers where incremental capabilities, such as X-LDF splicing, will be announced.<br />

        Spartanburg, SC - AFL is launching two new fiber optic fusion splicers: the FSM-100M and the FSM-100P for splicing polarization maintaining (PM) fibers. Both new specialty fiber fusion splicers offer a host of innovative technologies to address the rapidly expanding splicing needs for factory, manufacturing, laboratory, and R&D applications. The technologically superior splicing machines incorporate multiple pending patents.<br />
        <br />
        "The 100M and 100P series splicers further position Fujikura as the dominant player in the specialty splicer market. We are proud to offer customers around the world splicing products that are adaptable for a variety of specialty splicing needs, reliable, and consistent in performance, while providing a real value," said Kiyoshi Nakajima, General Manager; Splicer Business at Fujikura. "This new family of splicers is being introduced as the "ARCMaster®" series because of the unique capabilities to control the plasma zone of the fusion arc. These capabilities will revolutionize the way users splice various types of specialty fibers, including LDF, low contrast PM, and holey / micro-structured."<br />
        <br />
        Fujikura's new "ARCMaster®" splicers are engineered with a robust set of features that offer customers technology and reliability not available elsewhere:<br />
        <br />
        Patented "split v-groove" clamping system – accommodates optical fiber ranges from 60µm to 2000µm for cladding or coating without changing v-grooves or fiber clamps.<br />
        <br />
        Dual PM alignment technologies – Called IPA (Interrelation Profile Alignment), this new technology properly aligns and splices the increasing and technically challenging variety of PM fibers. The FSM-100P includes both traditional PAS alignment as well as the new IPA technology, providing users with the most comprehensive capabilities on the market for splicing PM fiber. IPA also enables accurate PER estimation for all PM fiber types.<br />
        <br />
        "Plasma Zone" fiber positioning – "ARCMaster®" splicers incorporate multiple fiber and electrode positioning techniques in order to provide unprecedented versatility for splicing LDF as well as heat sensitive or small diameter fibers.<br />
        <br />
        Special arc calibration technology – facilitates an easy transfer of high end splicing applications from R&D to production by ensuring consistent performance and enables full exploitation of "Plasma Zone" capabilities.<br />
        <br />
        Improved splice loss estimation technology – Combining the best features of both cold and warm splice imaging, these new generation splicers offer unprecedented accuracy for splice loss estimation.<br />
        <br />
        Zero degree fiber holder position – For splicing LDF fibers with minimal core angle, the fiber holders are horizontally positioned relative to the v-grooves thus minimizing higher order modes in double clad fibers. LDF splicing performance is also enhanced by the capability to mount the fiber holders in reversed orientation.<br />
        <br />
        Enhanced sweep arc technology – Increased travel range for "sweep arc" provides improved MFD matching capability and the ability for reshaping non-circular fibers in preparation for splicing.<br />
        <br />
        Production friendly design – A low profile design that eliminates fiber catch points, the dimensions of both splicers are consistent with the most popular production splicing work-benches in use today.<br />
        <br />
        Internet firmware updates – An industry first! Customers can now upgrade firmware as new capabilities become available from Fujikura. Upgrading is as simple as connecting a USB cable to your splicer.<br />
        <br />
        The need for Accurate, Reliable, and Consistent splicing is expanding to new applications beyond telecommunications. Today splicing is used for fiber lasers, sensors, medical applications, and research and development. These new "ARCMaster®" fusion splicers from Fujikura have been developed to provide the ultimate in performance and flexibility for a variety of customers and markets.<br />
        <br />
        Additional information can be found at www.StateoftheARC.com. Stay tuned to www.StateoftheARC.com for forthcoming additions to the "ARCMaster®" family of specialty fusion splicers where incremental capabilities, such as X-LDF splicing, will be announced.<br />
