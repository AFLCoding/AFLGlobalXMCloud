        Spartanburg, SC - AFL announces the introduction of the Noyes OFI-FTTx Active ONT Detector, a rugged, handheld optical fiber identifier based on the popular Noyes OFI 200D Series. The OFI-FTTx is designed to identify the presence or absence of an active Optical Network Terminal (ONT) on FTTx F2 fibers at a Fiber Distribution Hub.<br />
        <br />
        The new OFI is unique in that during testing, the F2 fiber does not have to be removed from service. Therefore, the OFI-FTTx can verify whether a splitter port at the FDH is connected to an active circuit before it is disconnected for fault location or re-use. The OFI-FTTx can also help verify FTTx network records, and recover splitter ports and F2 fibers that are connected at the FDH but in fact available for new customers. When applied to a splitter pigtail at the FDH, the OFI-FTTx will report that the ONT is either “active” or “not detected,” typically within three seconds.<br />
        <br />
        The OFI-FTTx is compatible with 2mm and 3mm jumper cables with standard single-mode fiber, such as SMF-28e™, or jumpers made with Bend Insensitive Fiber (BIF), such as AFL’s Bend Insensitive Cable Assemblies. The identifier is powered by two standard AAA alkaline batteries, and provides a low battery indication.<br />
