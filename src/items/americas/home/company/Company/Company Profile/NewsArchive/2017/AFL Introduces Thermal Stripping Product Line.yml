        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> introduces four new <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=82183B4AAA83481A9DE4BE801D7A56E0&_z=z">thermal strippers</a> for single and multi-fiber stripping. With superior stripping performance, the thermal stripper’s ergonomic design, combined with the low level of force needed for stripping, makes this series comfortable and easy-to-use for high fiber count applications.<br />
        <br />
        All thermal strippers feature a 3-second heating time and are capable of stripping 200 µm coated fibers and ribbons. The RS02 and RS03 models include a Bluetooth® enabled wireless connection for smartphones and provide a convenient way to program the stripper for user preferences via an Android or iOS smartphone app. The RS01 model is ideal for locations where Bluetooth technology is prohibited.<br />
         <br />
        “With the increased activity levels for high fiber count cable, and especially ribbon fiber construction utilizing 200 µm coated fibers, these new stripping tools are ideally suited to address the evolving needs of the market,” commented Greg Pickeral, product manager for AFL’s fusion splicing division. “The addition of Bluetooth capability not only provides a very convenient way to manage and program the stripper, but as other products evolve we’ll have even better opportunities to create a more robust tool management environment.”<br />
         <br />
        The RS03 models includes a powerful Lithium-Ion battery capable of 600 stripping cycles and the RS03-80 is offered for stripping 80 µm cladding fiber applications. A temperature selection switch permits easy field optimization for different fibers or operating conditions. These strippers accept all Fujikura field and factory style fiber holders.<br />
         <br />
        AFL offers a full line of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=55E85DE502FD4DF7A029245253934A91&_z=z">fusion splicers</a> and accessories including cleaving tools, fiber arrangement tools, splice protection sleeves and batteries. AFL operates the only authorized repair facility for Fujikura splicing products in the United States. AFL provides 24/7 technical support as well as complimentary onsite training with every splicer purchased.<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> introduces four new <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=82183B4AAA83481A9DE4BE801D7A56E0&_z=z">thermal strippers</a> for single and multi-fiber stripping. With superior stripping performance, the thermal stripper’s ergonomic design, combined with the low level of force needed for stripping, makes this series comfortable and easy-to-use for high fiber count applications.<br />
        <br />
        All thermal strippers feature a 3-second heating time and are capable of stripping 200 µm coated fibers and ribbons. The RS02 and RS03 models include a Bluetooth® enabled wireless connection for smartphones and provide a convenient way to program the stripper for user preferences via an Android or iOS smartphone app. The RS01 model is ideal for locations where Bluetooth technology is prohibited.<br />
         <br />
        “With the increased activity levels for high fiber count cable, and especially ribbon fiber construction utilizing 200 µm coated fibers, these new stripping tools are ideally suited to address the evolving needs of the market,” commented Greg Pickeral, product manager for AFL’s fusion splicing division. “The addition of Bluetooth capability not only provides a very convenient way to manage and program the stripper, but as other products evolve we’ll have even better opportunities to create a more robust tool management environment.”<br />
         <br />
        The RS03 models includes a powerful Lithium-Ion battery capable of 600 stripping cycles and the RS03-80 is offered for stripping 80 µm cladding fiber applications. A temperature selection switch permits easy field optimization for different fibers or operating conditions. These strippers accept all Fujikura field and factory style fiber holders.<br />
         <br />
        AFL offers a full line of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=55E85DE502FD4DF7A029245253934A91&_z=z">fusion splicers</a> and accessories including cleaving tools, fiber arrangement tools, splice protection sleeves and batteries. AFL operates the only authorized repair facility for Fujikura splicing products in the United States.
