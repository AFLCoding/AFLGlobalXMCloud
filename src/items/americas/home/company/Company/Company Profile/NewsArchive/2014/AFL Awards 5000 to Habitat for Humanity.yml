        Gwinnett, GA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> presented a $5K grant to <a href="http://www.habitatgwinnett.org/">Gwinnett Habitat for Humanity®</a>. Made possible by AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>, the grant supports construction of a local house, specifically addressing the need for affordable housing in the area.<br />
         <br />
        “Becoming a homeowner takes a commitment from the entire family and it also takes a commitment from the business community,” stated Mike Booth, president of AFL’s Network Services division. “AFL has long supported Habitat for Humanity affiliates and we are excited to bring the Community Outreach Program to this area and be a witness to the impact we can have in our community.”<br />
         <br />
        Gwinnett Habitat for Humanity has a goal to complete three new homes, rehab two homes and complete six home repair projects in 2014. Habitat homeowners must demonstrate a need, partner with Habitat by providing 250 “sweat equity” hours and demonstrate an ability to pay a mortgage.<br />
         <br />
        AFL has a history of giving back to its communities. AFL’s extensive Community Outreach Program starts within the company with its employee and extends out into the community through grants and sponsorships as well as employee engagement projects and tree planting events and more.<br />
