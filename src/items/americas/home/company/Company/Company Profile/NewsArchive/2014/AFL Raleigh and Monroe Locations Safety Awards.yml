        Raleigh and Monroe, NC – The <a href="http://www.nclabor.com/osha/etta/safety_programs/safety_award.htm">North Carolina Department of Labor Safety Awards program</a> presented <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> associates in Raleigh and Monroe with five “Gold Awards” at the 2014 Annual Union County Safety Awards Banquet hosted by South Piedmont Community College. The awards recognize their commitment toward promoting a safe and healthy work environment.<br />
        <br />
        The Gold Award is based on the DART rate, which includes cases of days away from work, restricted activity or job transfers; and recognizes companies for not having an injury that resulted in such cases.<br />
        <br />
        Both the Raleigh and Monroe locations received their fifth consecutive award in the enterprise category and their seventh consecutive award in the regional category. Additionally, Monroe received its first “Million Hour Safety Award.”<br />
        <br />
        The Million Hour Safety Award is given to companies that accumulate one million employee hours with no injuries or illnesses that resulted in days away from work. The Monroe location received that honor with zero employees missing work from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2012.<br />
        <br />
