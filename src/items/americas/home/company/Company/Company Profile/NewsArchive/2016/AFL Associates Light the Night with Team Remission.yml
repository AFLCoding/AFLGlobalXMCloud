        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a> associates and <a href="https://www.uscupstate.edu/academics/education/scholars_academy/">Spartanburg Scholars Academy students</a> joined together in support of two survivors of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)—Sam Brown and Justin McConnell—for this year’s <a href="https://www.lls.org/">Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</a>’s (LLS) <a href="http://www.lightthenight.org/">Light the Night Walk</a>. Both young men, children of two AFL associates, were diagnosed six months apart and formed Team Remission2 to help raise awareness and funding for the research of blood cancer treatments.<br />
        <br />
        With a $2,500 donation from AFL’s <a href=" /Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a> and donations from associates, friends, family and scholars, Team Remission2 surpassed its goal of $5,000 and collectively raised close to $10K for the organization.<br />
        <br />
        The Light the Night Walk is a community celebration of music, entertainment and camaraderie among friends, family and co-workers gathering to celebrate their fundraising success and demonstrate their support in the fight against blood cancers. More than 50 AFL associates, students, family and friends walked one mile in honor of survivors, in support of patients or in remembrance of those lost. This year’s event was attended by nearly 800 supporters and generated approximately $210,000 in funding support.<br />
         <br />
        Sam Brown and Justin McConnell are both survivors now. Sam is a junior in high school with aspirations of attending medical school with his twin brother, Jake. Both want to help defeat childhood cancer. Justin in currently in college where he’s studying to be a veterinarian.<br />
         <br />
