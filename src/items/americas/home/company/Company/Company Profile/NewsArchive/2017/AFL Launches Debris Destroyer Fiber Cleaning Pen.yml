        Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> released the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Cleaning/FCC3-Debris-Destroyer-Fiber-Cleaning-Pen.aspx">FCC3 Debris Destroyer pen</a>, a tool ideal for cleaning fiber optic connectors, adapter sleeves, optical distribution frame bulkheads and bare fibers in preparation for fusion splicing. In combination with wipes, tips and sticks, the pen works to remove connector end-face contaminants such as dirt, dust, oil and other debris, and eliminates electrostatic charge.<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/FCC3-00-PEN1_PR-_BG.aspx" target="_blank"></a><br />
        <br />
        The Debris Destroyer pen is saturated with 99 percent pure, medical grade isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to dissolve tough endface and bare fiber contaminants. It is recommended for use with the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Cleaning/One-Click_Cleaners.aspx">One-Click®</a> family of pen cleaners, <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Cleaning/WFW_and_FA1_-_FiberWipes_.aspx">FiberWipes™</a>, <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Cleaning/CCT_Connector_Cleaning_Tips.aspx">CCT Connector Cleaning Tips</a>, <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Cleaning/Cletop_(ACT)_Adapter_Cleaning_Sticks.aspx">CLETOP Adapter Cleaning Sticks</a>, <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Cleaning/CLETOP-S-Series-Optical-Connector-Cleaner.aspx">CLETOP cassette cleaners</a> and <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Cleaning/Reel-types-Cleaners/OPTIPOP-R-Cassette-Cleaner-Series.aspx">OPTIPOP cassette cleaners</a>. <br />
        <br />
        “For the most stubborn fiber cleaning tasks, AFL recommends a wet clean followed by a dry clean as best practice standard operating procedure,” explained Maury Wood, senior product manager for AFL’s Test & Inspection division. “Using the Debris Destroyer in conjunction with AFL’s other fiber cleaning products provides the strength to clean any endface contamination challenge.”<br />

        “For the most stubborn fiber cleaning tasks, AFL recommends a wet clean followed by a dry clean as best practice standard operating procedure,” explained Maury Wood, senior product manager for AFL’s Test & Inspection division. “Using the Debris Destroyer in conjunction with AFL’s other fiber cleaning products provides the strength to clean any endface contamination challenge.”<br />
