        Spartanburg, SC – Donning hard hats and wielding hammers, over 75 <a href="/">AFL</a> associates gave their time and construction skills to <a href="http://www.habitat.org/">Habitat for Humanity</a> in conjunction with AFL’s annual <a href="/Company/Community/United-Way ">United Way campaign</a>. Associates spent four days, May 7-10, working on three houses, two in Taylors, S.C. and one in Boiling Springs, S.C. As part of AFL’s ACT (AFL Community Team) project, Habitat for Humanity in both Greenville and Spartanburg each received a $1,500 grant to support their efforts.<br />
        <br />
        “One of AFL’s core values is community engagement—it’s part of our culture,” stated Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Our ACT volunteers understand the need for volunteerism and are eager to give back to make a difference in our community. Habitat for Humanity is a great example of associates reaching out in order to change the life of a family.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s United Way campaign last year was a resounding success and inspired this year’s construction-themed campaign, “Build It Up.” Beginning April 29 and ending May 20, this year’s campaign is focused on increasing awareness about community needs among AFL associates. Habitat for Humanity not only complemented this year’s theme, but also sparked enthusiasm among employees. The spark was so significant that it resulted in AFL’s largest ACT project to date.<br />
        <br />
        All of this is made possible by AFL’s <a href="/Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a>. Through the program, grants are awarded to numerous nonprofit organizations, scholarships are given to outstanding students, trees are planted through the <a href="/Company/Community/Take-Root ">Take Root Program</a>, relief is given to victims of tragedy and much more. In addition, AFL donates thousands to United Way and its initiatives each year.<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – Donning hard hats and wielding hammers, over 75 <a href="/">AFL</a> associates gave their time and construction skills to <a href="http://www.habitat.org/">Habitat for Humanity</a> in conjunction with AFL’s annual <a href="/Company/Community/United-Way ">United Way campaign</a>. Associates spent four days, May 7-10, working on three houses, two in Taylors, S.C. and one in Boiling Springs, S.C. As part of AFL’s ACT (AFL Community Team) project, Habitat for Humanity in both Greenville and Spartanburg each received a $1,500 grant to support their efforts.<br />
        <br />
        “One of AFL’s core values is community engagement—it’s part of our culture,” stated Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Our ACT volunteers understand the need for volunteerism and are eager to give back to make a difference in our community. Habitat for Humanity is a great example of associates reaching out in order to change the life of a family.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s United Way campaign last year was a resounding success and inspired this year’s construction-themed campaign, “Build It Up.” Beginning April 29 and ending May 20, this year’s campaign is focused on increasing awareness about community needs among AFL associates. Habitat for Humanity not only complemented this year’s theme, but also sparked enthusiasm among employees. The spark was so significant that it resulted in AFL’s largest ACT project to date.<br />
        <br />
        All of this is made possible by AFL’s <a href="/Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a>. Through the program, grants are awarded to numerous nonprofit organizations, scholarships are given to outstanding students, trees are planted through the <a href="/Company/Community/Take-Root ">Take Root Program</a>, relief is given to victims of tragedy and much more. In addition, AFL donates thousands to United Way and its initiatives each year.<br />
