        Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /default ">AFL</a> expanded its annual <a href=" /Company/Community/United-Way ">United Way</a> campaign this year to three locations, including <a href=" /Services/Training/The-Light-Brigade ">The Light Brigade®</a> in Tukwila, W.A. and AFL’s <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection ">NOYES® Test and Inspection Division</a> in Lowell, M.A. and Belmont, N.H.

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /default ">AFL</a> expanded its annual <a href=" /Company/Community/United-Way ">United Way</a> campaign this year to three locations, including <a href=" /Services/Training/The-Light-Brigade ">The Light Brigade®</a> in Tukwila, W.A. and AFL’s <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection ">NOYES® Test and Inspection Division</a> in Lowell, M.A. and Belmont, N.H. Combined, these locations gave $10,000 in support of their local United Way chapters.<br />
        <br />
        Associate giving for this year’s three-week campaign exceeded AFL’s goal of $7,500. Using AFL’s corporate headquarters theme “Build it Up,” associates were educated about United Way and the impact it has in their respective areas. Events were planned to coincide with the campaign and included lunches and agency speakers.<br />
        <br />
        “Across the United States, United Way is positively impacting our communities and AFL is committed to supporting their initiatives,” stated Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “By aligning our outreach program with their focus areas, we believe our efforts are multiplied.”  <br />
        <br />
        AFL has an extensive Community Outreach Program that includes grants, ACT projects, sponsorships, Take Root (a program to provide trees to communities), disaster relief and a yearly Week of Service.
