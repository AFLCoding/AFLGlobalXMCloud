        Spartanburg, SC – Two <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> associates were presented with patent awards for their work developing innovations to enhance technologies for AFL’s optical connectivity and apparatus products.<br />
         <br />
        Lawrence Srutkowski, research and development engineer, received a patent for his work on the Bristle Based Fiber Optic Connector Cleaner. This invention provides a single solution to clean male MT, female MT and single fiber ferrule connectors. Srutkowski developed a method where a cleaner surface is supported by a brush-like subsurface that allows the cleaning surface to conform to the connector shape.<br />
         <br />
        Chris Donaldson, research and development engineer, was awarded a patent for an AC Mains Filter and Power Supply System. Donaldson’s invention describes a field configurable electric noise filter for the power supply of residential modems and other telecommunication equipment, allowing service providers to improve triple play service for residences with noisy line power.<br />
