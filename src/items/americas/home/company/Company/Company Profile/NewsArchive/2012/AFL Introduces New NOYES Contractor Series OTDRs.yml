        AFL is introducing a new family of Contractor Series handheld OTDRs enabling cost-effective troubleshooting of FTTx PONs and point-to-point metro/access networks. The new CS260 OTDR family offers two models:<br />
        <br />
        CS260-10 FTTx PON Activation and Troubleshooting OTDR: 1625 nm Live PON OTDR providing 35 dB dynamic range, best-in-class 0.8 m event and 3.5 m attenuation dead zones, integrated PON power meter and Visual Fault Locator (VFL).<br />
        <br />
        CS260-20 Metro/Access Troubleshooting OTDR: 1310/1550 OTDR with 28 dB dynamic range, 0.8 m event and 3.5 m attenuation dead zones plus integrated Visual Fault Locator.<br />
        <br />
        "A large number of network operators utilize contractors to install and verify new metro and broadband access networks, including Fiber-to-the-Home PONs," explains Michael Scholten, senior product marketing manager for AFL's NOYES Test and Inspection division. "Those same network operators often don't want to subcontract customer-facing network activation and maintenance tasks. These operators must equip their direct staff to verify signal levels at the subscriber, install and activate premise equipment, and troubleshoot any problems."<br />
        <br />
        The CS260-10 and CS260-20 are purpose-built for optical network activation and troubleshooting tasks. With its integrated PON power meter, the CS260-10 enables technicians to verify PON power levels at an FTTx PON ONU or ONT. If downstream signals are absent or power is too low, the CS260-10's 1625 nm Live PON OTDR allows a technician to scan the network from the ONU/ONT or a network access point to locate fiber faults such as macro-bends, breaks, poor splices and dirty or damaged connectors. The live PON OTDR utilizes an out-of-band 1625 nm wavelength to prevent disruption to the 1310, 1490 and 1550 nm signals present on an in-service PON.<br />
        <br />
        The CS260-20 is designed to troubleshoot point-to-point metro/access networks operating in the 1310 and/or 1550 nm wavelength regions. Its short dead zones enable precise location of fiber faults. With 28 dB dynamic range, the CS260-20 can locate faults in networks up to 60 km (40 miles) in length.<br />
        <br />
        CS260s are derivatives of AFL's popular OFL280 and FLX380 FlexTester families and offer the same ease-of-use, high-contrast indoor/outdoor display and over 12 hours of continuous battery operation. Both models also include an integrated VFL (visible red laser) designed to visually pinpoint the location of macro-bends or breaks in splice closures, access terminals and splitter cabinets.<br />
        <br />
        CS260 OTDR results may be saved in industry-standard .SOR files and uploaded to PC via the built-in USB interface. Windows-compatible TRM® Test Results Manager software is supplied with the CS260s to support trace review, batch editing and professional test report generation.<br />

        AFL is introducing a new family of Contractor Series handheld OTDRs enabling cost-effective troubleshooting of FTTx PONs and point-to-point metro/access networks. The new CS260 OTDR family offers two models:<br />
        <br />
        CS260-10 FTTx PON Activation and Troubleshooting OTDR: 1625 nm Live PON OTDR providing 35 dB dynamic range, best-in-class 0.8 m event and 3.5 m attenuation dead zones, integrated PON power meter and Visual Fault Locator (VFL).<br />
        <br />
        CS260-20 Metro/Access Troubleshooting OTDR: 1310/1550 OTDR with 28 dB dynamic range, 0.8 m event and 3.5 m attenuation dead zones plus integrated Visual Fault Locator.<br />
        <br />
        "A large number of network operators utilize contractors to install and verify new metro and broadband access networks, including Fiber-to-the-Home PONs," explains Michael Scholten, senior product marketing manager for AFL's NOYES Test and Inspection division. "Those same network operators often don't want to subcontract customer-facing network activation and maintenance tasks. These operators must equip their direct staff to verify signal levels at the subscriber, install and activate premise equipment, and troubleshoot any problems."<br />
        <br />
        The CS260-10 and CS260-20 are purpose-built for optical network activation and troubleshooting tasks. With its integrated PON power meter, the CS260-10 enables technicians to verify PON power levels at an FTTx PON ONU or ONT. If downstream signals are absent or power is too low, the CS260-10's 1625 nm Live PON OTDR allows a technician to scan the network from the ONU/ONT or a network access point to locate fiber faults such as macro-bends, breaks, poor splices and dirty or damaged connectors. The live PON OTDR utilizes an out-of-band 1625 nm wavelength to prevent disruption to the 1310, 1490 and 1550 nm signals present on an in-service PON.<br />
        <br />
        The CS260-20 is designed to troubleshoot point-to-point metro/access networks operating in the 1310 and/or 1550 nm wavelength regions. Its short dead zones enable precise location of fiber faults. With 28 dB dynamic range, the CS260-20 can locate faults in networks up to 60 km (40 miles) in length.<br />
        <br />
        CS260s are derivatives of AFL's popular OFL280 and FLX380 FlexTester families and offer the same ease-of-use, high-contrast indoor/outdoor display and over 12 hours of continuous battery operation. Both models also include an integrated VFL (visible red laser) designed to visually pinpoint the location of macro-bends or breaks in splice closures, access terminals and splitter cabinets.<br />
        <br />
        CS260 OTDR results may be saved in industry-standard .SOR files and uploaded to PC via the built-in USB interface. Windows-compatible TRM® Test Results Manager software is supplied with the CS260s to support trace review, batch editing and professional test report generation.<br />
