        Melbourne, AU and Spartanburg, SC, USA – <a href="/">AFL</a> began its rebrand of <a href="/australia" title="AFL Australia">Optimal Cable Services</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable and provider of connectivity products based in Melbourne, Australia, shortly after it acquired the company in February.<br />
        <br />
        “As a leader in the North American market, we again have an opportunity to strengthen and broaden our customer relationships abroad—this time in the South Pacific,” said Aungwin Tin, general manager for AFL Australia. “We believe Optimal is fully capable of representing AFL’s customer-focused culture and we look forward to working with them to achieve great results.”<br />
        <br />
        Since 1986, AFL has acquired over 30 companies worldwide. Through these acquisitions, AFL has provided reliable solutions to multiple industries in nations across the world. Maintaining an ISO 9001 standard since its formation, Optimal will continue to operate in Melbourne and provide quality products to growing markets in the South Pacific.<br />
        <br />
        Tin added, “By combining our strengths in telecommunications, mining and general distribution markets, customers have the added benefit of a knowledgeable global leader committed to our customers first.” <br />
        <br />
        With a high demand for fiber optic cabling in Australia and access to valuable corporate resources, Optimal is expected to thrive under the AFL brand. In addition, Optimal will continue to offer its existing product portfolio, which includes assorted fiber optic cabling, testing and cleaning equipment, media converters and connectivity products.<br />

        Melbourne, AU and Spartanburg, SC, USA – <a href="/">AFL</a> began its rebrand of <a href="/australia" title="AFL Australia">Optimal Cable Services</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable and provider of connectivity products based in Melbourne, Australia, shortly after it acquired the company in February.<br />
        <br />
        “As a leader in the North American market, we again have an opportunity to strengthen and broaden our customer relationships abroad—this time in the South Pacific,” said Aungwin Tin, general manager for AFL Australia. “We believe Optimal is fully capable of representing AFL’s customer-focused culture and we look forward to working with them to achieve great results.”<br />
        <br />
        Since 1986, AFL has acquired over 30 companies worldwide. Through these acquisitions, AFL has provided reliable solutions to multiple industries in nations across the world. Maintaining an ISO 9001 standard since its formation, Optimal will continue to operate in Melbourne and provide quality products to growing markets in the South Pacific.<br />
        <br />
        Tin added, “By combining our strengths in telecommunications, mining and general distribution markets, customers have the added benefit of a knowledgeable global leader committed to our customers first.” <br />
        <br />
        With a high demand for fiber optic cabling in Australia and access to valuable corporate resources, Optimal is expected to thrive under the AFL brand. In addition, Optimal will continue to offer its existing product portfolio, which includes assorted fiber optic cabling, testing and cleaning equipment, media converters and connectivity products.<br />
