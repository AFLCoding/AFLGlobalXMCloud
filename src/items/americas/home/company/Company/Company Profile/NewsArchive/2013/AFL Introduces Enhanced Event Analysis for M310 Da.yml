        Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – With its high dynamic range, short dead zones and new advanced event analysis algorithm, <a href=" /">AFL</a>’s <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/M310-Enterprise-Data-Center-Multifunction-OTDR-w-O ">M310 Data Center OTDR</a> is the only solution in the industry which addresses the testing challenges associated with <a href=" /Solutions/Data-Center ">data center</a> and <a href=" /Solutions/Network-infrastructure ">enterprise</a> LAN/WAN networks. The advanced algorithm minimizes missed and false events and ensures accuracy and reliability in event analysis, taking advantage of short dead zones in data center applications.<br />
        <br />
        “If an OTDR’s event analysis is inaccurate, then documenting networks will be flawed and troubleshooting networks will be impaired, increasing downtime,” commented Mark Miller, product manager at AFL. “The M310’s event analysis successfully deals with difficult situations found in data centers such as short jumper cables and closely-spaced events. This ensures the health of your network.”<br />
        <br />
        Data center optical network configurations, such as Top of Rack (ToR) and End of Row (EoR), contain numerous closely-spaced sections, jumper cables, patch panels and cross connects. Through groundbreaking analysis techniques, the M310 accurately finds and measures the events on a network without increasing the likelihood of chasing false events. Coupled with the M310 Touch and Test® interface, users can confidently obtain accurate locations and measurements of all events, without the confusing introduction of false events. No special knowledge, training or test setups are required to achieve these results, saving users both time and money.<br />
        <br />
        With an integrated <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Optical-Power-Meters ">Optical Power Meter</a> (OPM) and <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Visual-Fault-Identifiers ">Visual Fault Locator</a> (VFL), plus inspection functionality using the <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/DFS1-Digital-FiberScope ">DFS1 Digital FiberScope</a>, the M310 provides all Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing requirements. The <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Software/Test-Results-Manager-PC-Analysis-and-Reporting ">Test Results Manager 2.0 (TRM® 2.0)</a> companion software provides the capability of viewing and editing test results on a PC, and creating certification reports.<br />

        Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – With its high dynamic range, short dead zones and new advanced event analysis algorithm, <a href=" /">AFL</a>’s <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/M310-Enterprise-Data-Center-Multifunction-OTDR-w-O ">M310 Data Center OTDR</a> is the only solution in the industry which addresses the testing challenges associated with <a href=" /Solutions/Data-Center ">data center</a> and <a href=" /Solutions/Network-infrastructure ">enterprise</a> LAN/WAN networks. The advanced algorithm minimizes missed and false events and ensures accuracy and reliability in event analysis, taking advantage of short dead zones in data center applications.<br />
        <br />
        “If an OTDR’s event analysis is inaccurate, then documenting networks will be flawed and troubleshooting networks will be impaired, increasing downtime,” commented Mark Miller, product manager at AFL. “The M310’s event analysis successfully deals with difficult situations found in data centers such as short jumper cables and closely-spaced events. This ensures the health of your network.”<br />
        <br />
        Data center optical network configurations, such as Top of Rack (ToR) and End of Row (EoR), contain numerous closely-spaced sections, jumper cables, patch panels and cross connects. Through groundbreaking analysis techniques, the M310 accurately finds and measures the events on a network without increasing the likelihood of chasing false events. Coupled with the M310 Touch and Test® interface, users can confidently obtain accurate locations and measurements of all events, without the confusing introduction of false events. No special knowledge, training or test setups are required to achieve these results, saving users both time and money.<br />
        <br />
        With an integrated <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Optical-Power-Meters ">Optical Power Meter</a> (OPM) and <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Visual-Fault-Identifiers ">Visual Fault Locator</a> (VFL), plus inspection functionality using the <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/DFS1-Digital-FiberScope ">DFS1 Digital FiberScope</a>, the M310 provides all Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing requirements. The <a href=" /Products/Test-and-Inspection/Software/Test-Results-Manager-PC-Analysis-and-Reporting ">Test Results Manager 2.0 (TRM® 2.0)</a> companion software provides the capability of viewing and editing test results on a PC, and creating certification reports.<br />
