        Spartanburg, SC – Over 50 <a href="/">AFL</a> associates gathered at the <a href="http://www.hopecfc.org/">Hope Center for Children</a>, located in downtown Spartanburg, to revamp outdoor areas across the nonprofit’s campus. The project, known as <a href="/Company/Community/ACT-Project ">ACT (AFL Community Team)</a>, engages volunteers from AFL, plus family and friends, to embark on a project within the community, lending a hand in service as well as providing a small grant.<br />
        <br />
        Known as a safe haven for neglected and abused children, the Hope Center houses an emergency shelter, a facility for long-term residential care and play areas for children of all ages. Many of the play areas are located outdoors and include a playground, open grass field and picnic shelter. However, many of these facilities were weather-beaten and very few of them provided shade.<br />
        <br />
        To help remedy these issues, a team of AFL associates built a concrete patio under a shade sail, which was installed earlier in the week by AFL volunteers. It will now provide current and future children with an escape from the summer sun. Another team sanded and painted the picnic shelter, two sheds and several rocking chairs. Vehicles, including school buses and vans, were washed inside and out, while several other associates spread mulch and cleared debris around the property.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL’s Community Outreach Program evolved in response to our community’s needs and as it’s grown over the years, it’s become engrained in our culture,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Our volunteers were committed to improving the outdoor area at the Hope Center for Children and ultimately built a refuge that can be used for years to come.”<br />
        <br />
        At the end of the project, AFL volunteers presented the Hope Center with a $1,000 grant made possible by <a href="/Company/Community ">AFL’s Community Outreach Program</a> in support of the organization’s mission, which is to break the cycle of abuse and neglect and build stable, healthy families.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s <a href="/Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a> awards dozens of grants each year in addition to planning volunteer projects for various nonprofits. The program also includes sponsorships, Take Root (a program to provide trees to communities), disaster relief, an annual United Way campaign and a yearly Week of Service.<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – Over 50 <a href="/">AFL</a> associates gathered at the <a href="http://www.hopecfc.org/">Hope Center for Children</a>, located in downtown Spartanburg, to revamp outdoor areas across the nonprofit’s campus. The project, known as <a href="/Company/Community/ACT-Project ">ACT (AFL Community Team)</a>, engages volunteers from AFL, plus family and friends, to embark on a project within the community, lending a hand in service as well as providing a small grant.<br />
        <br />
        Known as a safe haven for neglected and abused children, the Hope Center houses an emergency shelter, a facility for long-term residential care and play areas for children of all ages. Many of the play areas are located outdoors and include a playground, open grass field and picnic shelter. However, many of these facilities were weather-beaten and very few of them provided shade.<br />
        <br />
        To help remedy these issues, a team of AFL associates built a concrete patio under a shade sail, which was installed earlier in the week by AFL volunteers. It will now provide current and future children with an escape from the summer sun. Another team sanded and painted the picnic shelter, two sheds and several rocking chairs. Vehicles, including school buses and vans, were washed inside and out, while several other associates spread mulch and cleared debris around the property.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL’s Community Outreach Program evolved in response to our community’s needs and as it’s grown over the years, it’s become engrained in our culture,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Our volunteers were committed to improving the outdoor area at the Hope Center for Children and ultimately built a refuge that can be used for years to come.”<br />
        <br />
        At the end of the project, AFL volunteers presented the Hope Center with a $1,000 grant made possible by <a href="/Company/Community ">AFL’s Community Outreach Program</a> in support of the organization’s mission, which is to break the cycle of abuse and neglect and build stable, healthy families.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s <a href="/Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a> awards dozens of grants each year in addition to planning volunteer projects for various nonprofits. The program also includes sponsorships, Take Root (a program to provide trees to communities), disaster relief, an annual United Way campaign and a yearly Week of Service.<br />
