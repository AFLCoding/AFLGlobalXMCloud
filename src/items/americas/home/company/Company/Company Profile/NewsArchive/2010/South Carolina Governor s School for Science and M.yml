        Spartanburg, SC - AFL announces that the South Carolina Governor’s School for Science and Mathematics (GSSM) is the recipient of a $6,000 Fujikura Foundation grant to support its Summer Program for Research Interns (SPRI). In the summer of 2010, 54 rising seniors at GSSM, plus 15 to 20 SPRI Scholars from other SC high schools will immerse themselves in intense scientific research internships designed to help launch future careers. Seven of these students will be from the Greenville / Spartanburg area with two of those being supported with the Fujikura Foundation grant.<br />
        <br />
        "GSSM and the GSSM Foundation are grateful to AFL for their ongoing support of our capstone program. It is because of donors like AFL that we are able to deliver unique opportunities in scientific research to some of the smartest high school achievers in our state. Because of AFL’s investment, GSSM continues to raise the bar on quality education in science, math and technology," said Kim Bowman, Executive Director of the GSSM Foundation.<br />
        <br />
        GSSM is a two-year, public, residential high school located in Hartsville, SC. It is the only public high school in South Carolina dedicated to advanced education in science and math. Founded in 1988, GSSM has graduated nearly 1,200 alumni from every county in South Carolina, many of whom are now leaders in engineering, medicine, education, law, science, technology, research and business.<br />
        <br />
        "Meeting with students enrolled in this program last summer, I was impressed by their eagerness and drive to continue their education at universities state-wide, engaging in scientific research," said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. "AFL is honored to contribute to our future leaders and to a program that has already demonstrated remarkable success."<br />
