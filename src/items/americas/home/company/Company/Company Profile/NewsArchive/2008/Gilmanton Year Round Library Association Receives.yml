        Spartanburg, SC - Noyes Fiber Systems, a division of AFL, announces that the Gilmanton Year-Round Library Association is the recipient of a $2,500 Fujikura Foundation grant.  This grant will support the residents of Gilmanton by supplementing the funding efforts for a year-round library which is currently nearing completion.<br />
        <br />
        Currently Gilmanton residents are fortunate to have three seasonal libraries open May through October. With the opening of the Gilmanton Year-Round library, access will be available year round for educational resources, computers, periodicals, books on tape and other typical library services.<br />
        <br />
        “Through many years of dedication, hard work and determination, a group of volunteers are just short of providing Gilmanton with its first year-round library,” stated Elizabeth Bedard, President of the Gilmanton Year-Round Library Association. “As the recipient of this grant, we’ll be able to purchase books for the library. We’d like to thank the Fujikura Foundation for their generosity – we’re so excited to be one of the recipients of this grant!”<br />
        <br />
        The mission of the Gilmanton Year-Round Library Association is to provide this rural town with its first year-round library. Over 80% of the funds have been raised. With the land purchased and the structure built, the opening is very close.<br />
        <br />
        “Providing the supplemental funding for the library means that residents of Gilmanton will have the opportunity for additional education right in their home town,” stated Kim Hook, accounting assistant at Noyes Fiber Systems in Belmont, New Hampshire, and facilitator for the Fujikura Foundation. “We look forward to the opening of the Gilmanton Year-Round Library and plan to be there to celebrate the Grand Opening!”  <br />
        <br />
        Gilmanton is one of only two communities in New Hampshire without a year-round library.  Libraries, which can be described as “the cornerstone of an educated community”, provide lifelong learning and are critical in bridging the “digital divide”. For additional information on the library and how you can volunteer, e-mail ebedard18@gmail.com.<br />
