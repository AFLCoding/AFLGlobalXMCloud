        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, a global leader in fiber optics manufacturing and service provider, and AFL associates donated $183,800 to four United Way organizations across the nation. Combining their efforts under AFL’s three-week <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/United-Way.aspx">United Way Campaign</a> themed “Let’s Go Crazy,” AFL associates raised money and community awareness through fun team-building activities.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL aligns its Community Outreach Program with United Way’s impact areas: education, financial stability and health,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “We believe our donations help exponentially when we partner with organizations such as the United Way who have carefully surveyed our community and know where the need is.”<br />
        <br />
        Based in Duncan, S.C., AFL’s corporate headquarters raised $163,000 for the <a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a>, exceeding last year’s $145,000 donation and setting an AFL record. Through agency tours, luncheons and an 80’s costume contest, associates learned how United Way supports the Piedmont region became a part of that support by giving back.<br />
        <br />
        AFL locations in Belmont, New Hampshire and Lowell, Mass. raised a combined $6,000 for the <a href="http://www.graniteuw.org/">Granite United Way</a>. Associates participated in a number of activities to build excitement for the campaign, including a costume contest and weekly drawings.<br />
        <br />
        In Atlanta, associates presented an $8,500 donation to the <a href="https://www.unitedwayatlanta.org/">United Way of Greater Atlanta</a>, one of the largest United Way’s in the nation. Associates spent the campaign engaging in numerous community events, including decorating and filling over 100 snack bags for children who will take part in United Way programs over the summer.<br />
        <br />
        Light Brigade, AFL’s education and training division located in Tukwila, Wash., raised $6,300 for the <a href="http://www.uwkc.org/">United Way of King County</a>  which exceeded their goal by $3,600. Associates kicked off the campaign with a “lunch-and-learn” where a community speaker educated them on their community’s needs and the importance of giving.<br />
        <br />
        The United Way Campaign and donations were made possible by AFL’s extensive Community Outreach Program that includes grants, ACT (AFL Community Team) projects, sponsorships, Take Root (a program to provide trees to communities), disaster relief and more.

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, a global leader in fiber optics manufacturing and service provider, and AFL associates donated $183,800 to four United Way organizations across the nation. Combining their efforts under AFL’s three-week <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/United-Way.aspx">United Way Campaign</a> themed “Let’s Go Crazy,” AFL associates raised money and community awareness through fun team-building activities.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL aligns its Community Outreach Program with United Way’s impact areas: education, financial stability and health,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “We believe our donations help exponentially when we partner with organizations such as the United Way who have carefully surveyed our community and know where the need is.”<br />
        <br />
        Based in Duncan, S.C., AFL’s corporate headquarters raised $163,000 for the <a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a>, exceeding last year’s $145,000 donation and setting an AFL record. Through agency tours, luncheons and an 80’s costume contest, associates learned how United Way supports the Piedmont region became a part of that support by giving back.<br />
        <br />
        AFL locations in Belmont, New Hampshire and Lowell, Mass. raised a combined $6,000 for the <a href="http://www.graniteuw.org/">Granite United Way</a>. Associates participated in a number of activities to build excitement for the campaign, including a costume contest and weekly drawings.<br />
        <br />
        In Atlanta, associates presented an $8,500 donation to the <a href="https://www.unitedwayatlanta.org/">United Way of Greater Atlanta</a>, one of the largest United Way’s in the nation. Associates spent the campaign engaging in numerous community events, including decorating and filling over 100 snack bags for children who will take part in United Way programs over the summer.<br />
        <br />
        Light Brigade, AFL’s education and training division located in Tukwila, Wash., raised $6,300 for the <a href="http://www.uwkc.org/">United Way of King County</a>  which exceeded their goal by $3,600. Associates kicked off the campaign with a “lunch-and-learn” where a community speaker educated them on their community’s needs and the importance of giving.<br />
        <br />
        The United Way Campaign and donations were made possible by AFL’s extensive Community Outreach Program that includes grants, ACT (AFL Community Team) projects, sponsorships, Take Root (a program to provide trees to communities), disaster relief and more.
