        Tukwila, WA – The <a href="https://www.lightbrigade.com/Home.aspx">Light Brigade</a>, <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>’s education and training division, presented the <a href="http://www.uwkc.org/">United Way of King County</a> with $6,300. The gift was a direct result of AFL’s annual United Way campaign in which associates learn about United Way’s positive impact on local communities and become a part of that impact by giving back.<br />
        <br />
        During the three-week campaign, themed “Let’s Go Crazy and Live United,” campaign leaders invited a community speaker to educate associates about their community needs and the importance of giving. They also scheduled a “lunch-and-learn” to kick-off the campaign.<br />
        <br />
        “This year we exceeded our goal by $3,600, which is an incredible finish to an awesome campaign,” said Dario De Paolis, vice president and general manager of Light Brigade. “We look forward to next year and another opportunity to help our community in a big way.”<br />
        <br />
        The Light Brigade’s donation was made possible by associates and AFL’s Community Outreach Program which includes grants, ACT projects, sponsorships, Take Root (a program to provide trees to communities), disaster relief and a yearly Week of Service.
