        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> associates gathered on the outskirts of the Northside community in Spartanburg to join in a wall-raising ceremony with <a href="http://www.habitatspartanburg.org/">Habitat for Humanity of Spartanburg</a> and the Thompson family. The ceremony initiates the build of AFL’s second fully-funded Habitat for Humanity home in the Upstate. AFL associates, friends and family will volunteer their time throughout the four-month time period to help build this new home.<br />
        “Volunteering is an intrinsic part of AFL, our associates and our company culture,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “With nearly 900 associates in the Upstate, partnering with Habitat for Humanity allows us to serve others while learning about the need in the community. We’re grateful for this opportunity and look forward to supporting this investment with our time and talents.”<br />
         <br />
        Crystal Thompson and her five children are the future residents of this home. The family currently reside in a two-bedroom mobile home in Chesnee, which neither accommodates the needs of six people, nor offers them safety.<br />
         <br />
        “Owning a home is a true dream for me and my children—to have a place of our own where we don’t have to worry about mold and water or whether they’ll be safe outside, that’s been a goal of mine,” Crystal explained.<br />
         <br />
        Since 1987, Habitat Spartanburg has built 126 homes in the Spartanburg community. The AFL Build marks their 127th home. Families are selected based on need, income and willingness to partner with Habitat, and homeowners must complete financial counseling and 250 hours of “sweat equity.” As of 2011, Habitat Spartanburg is offering homeowners and their neighbors’ social services including health screenings, counseling and access to job fairs.<br />
         <br />
        AFL’s Community Outreach Program is extensive and includes grants, sponsorships, employee engagement projects, disaster relief and more. For more information about AFL and its Community Outreach visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />

        “Volunteering is an intrinsic part of AFL, our associates and our company culture,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “With nearly 900 associates in the Upstate, partnering with Habitat for Humanity allows us to serve others while learning about the need in the community. We’re grateful for this opportunity and look forward to supporting this investment with our time and talents.”<br />
         <br />
        Crystal Thompson and her five children are the future residents of this home. The family currently reside in a two-bedroom mobile home in Chesnee, which neither accommodates the needs of six people, nor offers them safety.<br />
         <br />
        “Owning a home is a true dream for me and my children—to have a place of our own where we don’t have to worry about mold and water or whether they’ll be safe outside, that’s been a goal of mine,” Crystal explained.<br />

Families are selected based on need, income and willingness to partner with Habitat, and homeowners must complete financial counseling and 250 hours of “sweat equity.” As of 2011, Habitat Spartanburg is offering homeowners and their neighbors’ social services including health screenings, counseling and access to job fairs.<br />
