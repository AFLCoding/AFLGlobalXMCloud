        Los Gatos, CA & Spartanburg, SC - Procera® Networks, Inc. (PRNW.OB), a pioneering developer of intelligent network traffic and service management infrastructure equipment, and AFL, a division of Fujikura Ltd. of Japan, an industry leader in fiber optic products and services, announce that they will co-launch a series of live webcasts aimed at educating both companies’ customer bases about the many uses of Procera’s PacketLogic line of network appliances. AFL has been a certified reseller of PacketLogic since October 2006. The co-sponsored webcasts will start May 2 at 2:00 p.m. EDT and will continue about every three weeks throughout the summer season.<br />
        <br />
        “Hosted by an expert panel, the webcast series will include live demonstrations of the PacketLogic appliance and will highlight how PacketLogic can drive bottom-line results via network monitoring and bandwidth shaping - tools that can help network operators manage existing traffic and efficiently deploy new revenue-generating services,” says Kent Brown, Director of Access Solutions at AFL.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to the core bandwidth management benefits of the platform, PacketLogic is a great addition to any company that might have concerns over compliance with CALEA - the new law requiring service providers to assist law enforcement agencies when served a warrant.<br />
        <br />
        The PacketLogic solution gives broadband service providers a traffic management solution to optimize and control their network while simultaneously offering a cost effective CALEA technical assistance compliance solution. The PacketLogic solution adds value to the network by delivering traffic analysis along with a management function that helps the service provider better monitor overall network traffic. With this increased visibility and knowledge, the service provider can use the PacketLogic device to implement policies to manage, control or optimize bandwidth usage. The key function that PacketLogic provides is the ability for the service provider to potentially realize incremental revenue opportunities.<br />
        <br />
        Planned dates for the webcasts are May 2, May 23, June 13, July 11 and August 1, each lasting approximately one hour<br />

        Los Gatos, CA & Spartanburg, SC - Procera® Networks, Inc. (PRNW.OB), a pioneering developer of intelligent network traffic and service management infrastructure equipment, and AFL, a division of Fujikura Ltd. of Japan, an industry leader in fiber optic products and services, announce that they will co-launch a series of live webcasts aimed at educating both companies’ customer bases about the many uses of Procera’s PacketLogic line of network appliances. AFL has been a certified reseller of PacketLogic since October 2006. The co-sponsored webcasts will start May 2 at 2:00 p.m. EDT and will continue about every three weeks throughout the summer season.<br />
        <br />
        “Hosted by an expert panel, the webcast series will include live demonstrations of the PacketLogic appliance and will highlight how PacketLogic can drive bottom-line results via network monitoring and bandwidth shaping - tools that can help network operators manage existing traffic and efficiently deploy new revenue-generating services,” says Kent Brown, Director of Access Solutions at AFL.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to the core bandwidth management benefits of the platform, PacketLogic is a great addition to any company that might have concerns over compliance with CALEA - the new law requiring service providers to assist law enforcement agencies when served a warrant.<br />
        <br />
        The PacketLogic solution gives broadband service providers a traffic management solution to optimize and control their network while simultaneously offering a cost effective CALEA technical assistance compliance solution. The PacketLogic solution adds value to the network by delivering traffic analysis along with a management function that helps the service provider better monitor overall network traffic. With this increased visibility and knowledge, the service provider can use the PacketLogic device to implement policies to manage, control or optimize bandwidth usage. The key function that PacketLogic provides is the ability for the service provider to potentially realize incremental revenue opportunities.<br />
        <br />
        Planned dates for the webcasts are May 2, May 23, June 13, July 11 and August 1, each lasting approximately one hour<br />
