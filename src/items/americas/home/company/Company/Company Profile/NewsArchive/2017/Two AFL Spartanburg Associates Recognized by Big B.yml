        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> associates, Lauren Cramer and Bryan Eddy, were recognized by <a href="http://www.bbbsupstate.com/site/c.htINI3PIKoG/b.3880885/k.F026/Home_Page.htm">Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) of the Upstate</a> for their exceptional service. Lauren Cramer, purchasing manager for AFL, was presented with the Big Sister of the Year award for Spartanburg County and the Spurgeon Legacy Award/Upstate Big of the Year. Bryan Eddy, product engineer for AFL, was presented with the Big Brother of the Year award for Spartanburg. The awards are given based on being an active match for one year in the community-based or school-based program and going above-and-beyond for their “little.”<br />
        <br />
        Lauren Cramer has been a devoted mentor at BBBS in Spartanburg for more than four years, taking her to community events, working on school projects together, exploring new restaurants and helping her with back-to-school shopping. Cramer stated, “The experience has changed my outlook on life. It has opened my eyes to the needs within our community and the impact that just one person can have on another child’s life. Whether we work on homework, study for a test, or watch a movie, the time we spend together has a lasting impact on both of us.”<br />
        <br />
        Allison Caulk, director of BBBS Spartanburg, remarked, “These two are like tried-and-true sisters and Lauren said no matter what happens, her little sister will always be a part of her life! Her little told us that she knows no matter what, she always feels she can depend on Lauren. Her genuine care and concern for others in our program is heart-warming.”<br />
        <br />
        Bryan Eddy started mentoring his little brother at the beginning of the 2016 school year. “It’s a very humbling and heartwarming experience knowing a child anxiously awaits all week long for a chance to spend time with someone who cares,” stated Eddy. “My little always brightens my day. When we are together, I am lost in the moment. I want everyone to have the opportunity to mentor a little—it’s an indescribably wonderful feeling.”<br />
        <br />
        Caulk continued, “It didn’t take too long before Bryan and his little became best buds and even though he is a mentor in our school-based program which is not as flexible as the community program, any time there is an event, Bryan is there alongside his little brother! He really helped him academically, socially and also helped him become more confident.”<br />
        <br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> associates, Lauren Cramer and Bryan Eddy, were recognized by <a href="http://www.bbbsupstate.com/site/c.htINI3PIKoG/b.3880885/k.F026/Home_Page.htm">Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) of the Upstate</a> for their exceptional service. Lauren Cramer, purchasing manager for AFL, was presented with the Big Sister of the Year award for Spartanburg County and the Spurgeon Legacy Award/Upstate Big of the Year. Bryan Eddy, product engineer for AFL, was presented with the Big Brother of the Year award for Spartanburg. The awards are given based on being an active match for one year in the community-based or school-based program and going above-and-beyond for their “little.”<br />
        <br />
        Lauren Cramer has been a devoted mentor at BBBS in Spartanburg for more than four years, taking her to community events, working on school projects together, exploring new restaurants and helping her with back-to-school shopping. Cramer stated, “The experience has changed my outlook on life. It has opened my eyes to the needs within our community and the impact that just one person can have on another child’s life. Whether we work on homework, study for a test, or watch a movie, the time we spend together has a lasting impact on both of us.”<br />
        <br />
        Allison Caulk, director of BBBS Spartanburg, remarked, “These two are like tried-and-true sisters and Lauren said no matter what happens, her little sister will always be a part of her life! Her little told us that she knows no matter what, she always feels she can depend on Lauren. Her genuine care and concern for others in our program is heart-warming.”<br />
        <br />
        Bryan Eddy started mentoring his little brother at the beginning of the 2016 school year. “It’s a very humbling and heartwarming experience knowing a child anxiously awaits all week long for a chance to spend time with someone who cares,” stated Eddy. “My little always brightens my day. When we are together, I am lost in the moment. I want everyone to have the opportunity to mentor a little—it’s an indescribably wonderful feeling.”<br />
        <br />
        Caulk continued, “It didn’t take too long before Bryan and his little became best buds and even though he is a mentor in our school-based program which is not as flexible as the community program, any time there is an event, Bryan is there alongside his little brother! He really helped him academically, socially and also helped him become more confident.”<br />
