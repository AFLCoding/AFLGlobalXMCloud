        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> awarded <a href="http://www.unioncountyturningpoint.org/index.php">Turning Point</a>, an organization that exists to break the cycle of abuse, with a $2,500 grant for its Children’s HERO Program. The HERO program (Help, Encouragement and Recognition of Child Observers of Domestic Violence) consists of a series of eight-week sessions that help child victims of domestic violence. Through this program, children learn the social and life skills needed to improve their self-image and create a more rewarding future.<br />
        <br />
        “Before domestic violence can be eliminated, the generational cycle of abuse must be broken and the HERO Program works toward that end,” said Naomi Herndon, executive director for Turning Point. “Through the HERO Program, children are taught how to identify feelings and understand family violence. Perhaps most importantly, the children are taught that the violence is not their fault and that they can lead a life free of violence.”<br />
        <br />
        The grant, made possible by AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>, will support educational field trips. Since children who witness or endure domestic violence are not always permitted to play with their peers, the HERO program provides a safe and fully-supervised environment that encourages interaction and child play. With one visit to the local animal shelter or nearby zoo, children can use their recently acquired skills in a public setting; build their self-esteem and create positive memories.<br />
        <br />
        “Turning Point is an instrumental organization within our community that has proven positive outcomes for child victims,” stated Darren Corley, general manager at AFL. “Breaking the cycle of abuse is a monumental task and Turning Point has the vision and resources to help victims heal. We are excited to support Turning Point and their efforts.”<br />

        The grant, made possible by AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>, will support educational field trips. Since children who witness or endure domestic violence are not always permitted to play with their peers, the HERO program provides a safe and fully-supervised environment that encourages interaction and child play. With one visit to the local animal shelter or nearby zoo, children can use their recently acquired skills in a public setting; build their self-esteem and create positive memories.<br />
        <br />
        “Turning Point is an instrumental organization within our community that has proven positive outcomes for child victims,” stated Darren Corley, general manager at AFL. “Breaking the cycle of abuse is a monumental task and Turning Point has the vision and resources to help victims heal. We are excited to support Turning Point and their efforts.”<br />
