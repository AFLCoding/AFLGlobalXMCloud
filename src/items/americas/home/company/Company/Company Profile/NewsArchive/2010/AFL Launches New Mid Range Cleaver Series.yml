        Spartanburg, SC - AFL announces the launch of its new mid-range cleaver series, both providing high quality cleaving at an economical price. Compact and lightweight, both cleavers are ideal for field installations and mechanical splices.<br />
        <br />
        The CT-10A series fiber cleaver is designed for cleaving single fibers only with average angles of 0.5 degrees. The rugged yet scaled-down design offers a simple, single-step operation and high precision cleaves. An optional scrap collector is available.<br />
        <br />
        The CT-11A single fiber cleaver is specifically designed for angled cleaving applications. Supplied with a factory adjustment to the industry standard of eight degrees, the CT-11A has the ability to cleave up to nine degrees. Rugged and durable, this cleaver is ideal for FTTH installers and others working in harsh environments.<br />
        <br />
        Both cleavers incorporate an easily replaceable blade and cleave 250µm and 900µm fibers. The CT-10A and CT-11A are easy to use, simple to adjust and extremely consistent. For additional information, visit www.aflglobal.com.<br />
