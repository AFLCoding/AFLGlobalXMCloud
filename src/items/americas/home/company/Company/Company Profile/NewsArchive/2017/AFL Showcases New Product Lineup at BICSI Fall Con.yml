        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an industry-leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, is exhibiting at the BICSI Fall Conference and Exhibition in Las Vegas, September 24-28. Stop by Booth #705 to see AFL’s newest product solutions including <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Wrapping-Tube-Cable.aspx">Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC) with SpiderWeb Ribbon®</a>, <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Rogue.aspx">ROGUE®</a>/<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Software/aeRos.aspx">aeRos® Workflow Management</a> solution and the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-WiFi2-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-Syste.aspx">FOCIS WiFi2 Fiber Inspection System</a>.<br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Wrapping-Tube-Cable.aspx">Wrapping Tube Cable with SWR®</a> is an ultra-high density fiber optic cable that uses a ribbon technology called SpiderWeb Ribbon, a bonded fiber ribbon design that allows for highly efficient ribbon splicing or an individual fiber breakout splicing process. Available in dielectric or double jacket single armor and in fiber counts from 144 to 1,728, WTC provides the smallest cable diameter and lowest weight, high-fiber count ribbon cable in the industry. Fully qualified to Telcordia GR-20, WTC is ideal for data center building interconnections, access provider metro rings, service provider FTTx and cable TV subscriber networks.<br />
         <br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Rogue.aspx">ROGUE</a> is AFL's open, flexible, modular test platform that enables users to pick and choose the functionality they need. By pairing ROGUE modules with apps running on a smart device, test capabilities can be created for specific jobs. This patent-pending architecture enables technicians to control their test hardware directly from any Android, IOS or Windows smart device. ROGUE ODTR modules are supported by AFL’s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Software/aeRos.aspx">aeRos workflow management solution</a>, a cloud-based, comprehensive workflow management solution that integrates every aspect of the testing process.<br />

        AFL’s newest product, the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Software/aeRos.aspx">aeRos</a>-connected <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-WiFi2-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-Syste.aspx">FOCIS WiFi2</a>, is the next generation fiber optic connector inspection system that uses an Android or iOS wireless connection for live image video streaming and auto-focus. Ergonomic and lightweight, the FOCIS WiFi2 has a single multipurpose button, a single multi-color functional status LED, and a battery charging port for all day mobility. The status LED enhances workflow productivity by allowing rapid operator assessment of the cleanliness of the fiber endface—either passing or failing standard rules—as well as “fiber not found” error notification.<br />
         <br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an industry-leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, is exhibiting at the BICSI Fall Conference and Exhibition in Las Vegas, September 24-28. Stop by Booth #705 to see AFL’s newest product solutions including <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Wrapping-Tube-Cable.aspx">Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC) with SpiderWeb Ribbon®</a>, <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Rogue.aspx">ROGUE®</a>/<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Software/aeRos.aspx">aeRos® Workflow Management</a> solution and the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-WiFi2-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-Syste.aspx">FOCIS WiFi2 Fiber Inspection System</a>.<br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Wrapping-Tube-Cable.aspx">Wrapping Tube Cable with SWR®</a> is an ultra-high density fiber optic cable that uses a ribbon technology called SpiderWeb Ribbon, a bonded fiber ribbon design that allows for highly efficient ribbon splicing or an individual fiber breakout splicing process. Available in dielectric or double jacket single armor and in fiber counts from 144 to 1,728, WTC provides the smallest cable diameter and lowest weight, high-fiber count ribbon cable in the industry. Fully qualified to Telcordia GR-20, WTC is ideal for data center building interconnections, access provider metro rings, service provider FTTx and cable TV subscriber networks.<br />
         <br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Rogue.aspx">ROGUE</a> is AFL's open, flexible, modular test platform that enables users to pick and choose the functionality they need. By pairing ROGUE modules with apps running on a smart device, test capabilities can be created for specific jobs. This patent-pending architecture enables technicians to control their test hardware directly from any Android, IOS or Windows smart device. ROGUE ODTR modules are supported by AFL’s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Software/aeRos.aspx">aeRos workflow management solution</a>, a cloud-based, comprehensive workflow management solution that integrates every aspect of the testing process.<br />
         <br />
        AFL’s newest product, the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Software/aeRos.aspx">aeRos</a>-connected <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-WiFi2-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-Syste.aspx">FOCIS WiFi2</a>, is the next generation fiber optic connector inspection system that uses an Android or iOS wireless connection for live image video streaming and auto-focus. Ergonomic and lightweight, the FOCIS WiFi2 has a single multipurpose button, a single multi-color functional status LED, and a battery charging port for all day mobility. The status LED enhances workflow productivity by allowing rapid operator assessment of the cleanliness of the fiber endface—either passing or failing standard rules—as well as “fiber not found” error notification.<br />
