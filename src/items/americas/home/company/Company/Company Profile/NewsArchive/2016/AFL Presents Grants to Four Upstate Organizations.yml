        Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /">AFL</a> awarded $23,000 in community outreach grants to four local nonprofit organizations that will support STEM education and various social programs in the upstate of South Carolina. Recipients include the Middle Tyger YMCA, Boys & Girls Clubs of the Upstate, Habitat for Humanity Spartanburg and Miracle Hill Ministries. All grants were made possible by AFL’s <a href=" /Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a>.
        <div>The <a href="http://www.spartanburgymca.org/index.php">YMCA of Greater Spartanburg</a> received an $8,000 grant that will support its Partners with Youth program at the <a href="http://www.spartanburgymca.org/middle-tyger-ymca.php">Middle Tyger YMCA</a>. This program provides scholarships to families who are unable to afford sending their child(ren) to summer day camp. The grant will help ensure that the YMCA is fiscally positioned to provide the highest quality program to all children, regardless of economic status.  <br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://miraclehill.org/">Miracle Hill Ministries</a> was the recipient of a $5,000 grant for its Family Strengthening Program which provides support for families during times of crisis through transition to family stability. The target group is families whose DSS/court goal is reunification with their children. The grant will be used for emergency funds such as deposits for housing, utility bills, rent, fees, etc.<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="http://www.bgcusc.org/">Boys & Girls Clubs of the Upstate</a> is also a $5,000 grant recipient.

The LEGO First League is a Life Skills activity that includes STEM via LEGOS to teach teamwork, following instructions, planning, building and presentation.<br />
        <br />
