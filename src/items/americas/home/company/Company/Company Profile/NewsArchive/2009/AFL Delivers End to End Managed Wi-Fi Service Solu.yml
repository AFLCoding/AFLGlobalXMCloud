        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;"><strong>Spartanburg, SC</strong> - With million dollar views and a recently completed $34 million dollar resort-wide renovation, the Hyatt Regency Newport’s spectacular private island location is the perfect setting for its event facility. Featuring versatile meeting space, the facility required high-performance mobile Wi-Fi coverage enabling guests to maintain seamless connectivity throughout the facility. AFL and BelAir Networks addressed these requirements as part of an end-to-end managed Wi-Fiservice solution.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">“For our requirements, BelAir Networks’ products deliver the highest performance ubiquitous coverage at the lowest cost – and they’re quick and easy to deploy so there’s no disruption to our guests,” said Ron Hardin, IT Director, Davidson Hotel Company, one of the nation’s largest independent hotel management companies. Davidson Hotel Company bought the Hyatt Regency Newport in a joint venture with Amstar Group in 2006. “Davidson Hotel Company consistently creates and enhances value in each of its owned and managed properties and BelAir Networks high-performance Wi-Fi has become part of that value proposition.”</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">AFL provides Davidson Hotel Company with an end–to-end managed Wi-Fi service solution to address their requirements at the Hyatt Regency Newport and other hotels and resorts in the Davidson portfolio. AFL deployed just eight BelAir100 wireless access points to provide high-performance Wi-Fi coverage of 27,000 square feet of function space, including ballrooms, meeting rooms and pre-function areas. AFL’s end-to-end solution at the Hyatt Regency Newport includes network design, installation, management and ongoing support. AFL also installed and supports a new Internet connectivity management and billing system along with a solution for application-specific traffic management and bandwidth shaping to ensure a consistent user experience.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">“Because we’re providing an end-to-end managed Wi-Fi service solution, we want best-of- breed technology that’s easy to manage, and, of course, cost is always an issue,” said Kent Brown, Director, Access Solutions, AFL. “Whatever the deployment situation – indoors, outdoors, in both new installations and network upgrades/replacements – we’ve found that BelAir Networks’ comprehensive portfolio of indoor and outdoor Wi-Fi networking products consistently deliver high-performance, highly reliable and very cost-effective Wi-Fi coverage that we can deploy quickly and manage both centrally and remotely.”</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Driven by the powerful, feature-rich BelAirOS operating system software and managed by BelView, BelAir Networks offers the industry’s most comprehensive product portfolio of indoor access points (AP) and outdoor wireless nodes supporting both Wi-Fi and WiMAX, as well as public safety, defense and intelligent transportation system (ITS) frequency bands. BelAir Networks’ deployments require less equipment and wiring than traditional Wi-Fi access points, reducing the cost, time, labor and maintenance associated with the network deployment and its ongoing operation. Hosted software-based control enables centralized management and lowers network CapEx by about 30%. The highly reliable and esthetically attractive BelAir nodes and APs enable hotel operators to get Wi-Fi up and running quickly with no disruption to guests, visitors or staff.</p>

        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;"><strong>Spartanburg, SC</strong> - With million dollar views and a recently completed $34 million dollar resort-wide renovation, the Hyatt Regency Newport’s spectacular private island location is the perfect setting for its event facility. Featuring versatile meeting space, the facility required high-performance mobile Wi-Fi coverage enabling guests to maintain seamless connectivity throughout the facility. AFL and BelAir Networks addressed these requirements as part of an end-to-end managed Wi-Fiservice solution.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">“For our requirements, BelAir Networks’ products deliver the highest performance ubiquitous coverage at the lowest cost – and they’re quick and easy to deploy so there’s no disruption to our guests,” said Ron Hardin, IT Director, Davidson Hotel Company, one of the nation’s largest independent hotel management companies. Davidson Hotel Company bought the Hyatt Regency Newport in a joint venture with Amstar Group in 2006. “Davidson Hotel Company consistently creates and enhances value in each of its owned and managed properties and BelAir Networks high-performance Wi-Fi has become part of that value proposition.”</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">AFL provides Davidson Hotel Company with an end–to-end managed Wi-Fi service solution to address their requirements at the Hyatt Regency Newport and other hotels and resorts in the Davidson portfolio. AFL deployed just eight BelAir100 wireless access points to provide high-performance Wi-Fi coverage of 27,000 square feet of function space, including ballrooms, meeting rooms and pre-function areas. AFL’s end-to-end solution at the Hyatt Regency Newport includes network design, installation, management and ongoing support. AFL also installed and supports a new Internet connectivity management and billing system along with a solution for application-specific traffic management and bandwidth shaping to ensure a consistent user experience.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">“Because we’re providing an end-to-end managed Wi-Fi service solution, we want best-of- breed technology that’s easy to manage, and, of course, cost is always an issue,” said Kent Brown, Director, Access Solutions, AFL. “Whatever the deployment situation – indoors, outdoors, in both new installations and network upgrades/replacements – we’ve found that BelAir Networks’ comprehensive portfolio of indoor and outdoor Wi-Fi networking products consistently deliver high-performance, highly reliable and very cost-effective Wi-Fi coverage that we can deploy quickly and manage both centrally and remotely.”</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Driven by the powerful, feature-rich BelAirOS operating system software and managed by BelView, BelAir Networks offers the industry’s most comprehensive product portfolio of indoor access points (AP) and outdoor wireless nodes supporting both Wi-Fi and WiMAX, as well as public safety, defense and intelligent transportation system (ITS) frequency bands. BelAir Networks’ deployments require less equipment and wiring than traditional Wi-Fi access points, reducing the cost, time, labor and maintenance associated with the network deployment and its ongoing operation. Hosted software-based control enables centralized management and lowers network CapEx by about 30%. The highly reliable and esthetically attractive BelAir nodes and APs enable hotel operators to get Wi-Fi up and running quickly with no disruption to guests, visitors or staff.</p>
