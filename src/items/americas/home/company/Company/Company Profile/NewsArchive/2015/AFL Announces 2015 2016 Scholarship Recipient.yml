        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> presented the 2015-2016 <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/Community-Initiatives.aspx">Naruse Academic Scholarship</a> award to Laura Franco, daughter of Ramon Franco, international sales manager for AFL. Laura Franco receives this award in recognition of her outstanding academic and extracurricular achievements during her high school career.<br />
        <br />
        Ranked at the top of her class at St. Joseph’s Catholic School, Laura is a member of the National Honor Society and recipient of the Furman Scholar Award. She has been involved in various clubs focused on educating future health care professionals throughout high school. Laura also served as president of the Greenville Health System (GHS) Health Careers Club and interned at GHS through their MedEx program last summer. She has been an active volunteer at the hospital and hopes to continue this throughout her college career.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to her dedication to academics, Laura has a passion for community service. Starting in tenth grade, she began a service project in collaboration with the Children’s Hospital, where she donates decorated composition books for children and parents to use as journals during their time in the hospital. After receiving positive feedback, she was contacted by March of Dimes to donate journals for mothers to use while their child was in the NICU. This project has involved over 500 hours and has been able to help over 200 families. In addition to her project with March of Dimes, Laura has been involved in international projects during the summer and referees youth soccer games on her free weekends.<br />
        <br />
        While she was accepted to Washington University in St. Louis, Furman and Clemson, Laura plans to attend Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, where she plans to major in Anthropology and Human Biology, with a minor in French. Her ultimate goal is to attend medical school and become a pediatrician.<br />
        <br />
        Administered by the Center for Scholarship Administration, AFL’s Naruse Academic Scholarship is awarded to eligible senior high school students of full time U.S.-based AFL associates with a minimum of one year of service. The amount of the scholarship is up to $2,000 per year with a cap of $8,000 per student per year over a four-year period. The award is applied to the cost of tuition, room and board, fees, books and supplies.<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> presented the 2015-2016 <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/Community-Initiatives.aspx">Naruse Academic Scholarship</a> award to Laura Franco, daughter of Ramon Franco, international sales manager for AFL. Laura Franco receives this award in recognition of her outstanding academic and extracurricular achievements during her high school career.<br />
        <br />
        Ranked at the top of her class at St. Joseph’s Catholic School, Laura is a member of the National Honor Society and recipient of the Furman Scholar Award. She has been involved in various clubs focused on educating future health care professionals throughout high school. Laura also served as president of the Greenville Health System (GHS) Health Careers Club and interned at GHS through their MedEx program last summer. She has been an active volunteer at the hospital and hopes to continue this throughout her college career.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to her dedication to academics, Laura has a passion for community service. Starting in tenth grade, she began a service project in collaboration with the Children’s Hospital, where she donates decorated composition books for children and parents to use as journals during their time in the hospital. After receiving positive feedback, she was contacted by March of Dimes to donate journals for mothers to use while their child was in the NICU. This project has involved over 500 hours and has been able to help over 200 families. In addition to her project with March of Dimes, Laura has been involved in international projects during the summer and referees youth soccer games on her free weekends.<br />
        <br />
        While she was accepted to Washington University in St. Louis, Furman and Clemson, Laura plans to attend Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, where she plans to major in Anthropology and Human Biology, with a minor in French. Her ultimate goal is to attend medical school and become a pediatrician.<br />
        <br />
