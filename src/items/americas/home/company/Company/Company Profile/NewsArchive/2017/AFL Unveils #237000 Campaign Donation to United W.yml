        Spartanburg, SC – May 23, 2017 – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a global manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, concluded its annual United Way campaign with a $237,000 donation to <a href="http://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a>. Made possible by AFL associates and AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>, the donation set a record with a 14 percent increase over the previous year and a 37 percent increase in donors.<br />
        <br />
        "United Way of the Piedmont has a pulse on the community and knows where the need is,” explained Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “We are confident that our investment and our associates’ investments are making our community even better.”<br />
        <br />
        This year’s United Way campaign theme was “Be Someone’s Hero.” Associates were invited to learn more about <a href="http://shrcc.org/">SAFE Homes-Rape Crisis Coalition</a>, a United Way funded agency, via a video to gain a better understanding of the agency, United Way of the Piedmont and how United Way supports them and other agencies in the community. Both Chick-fil-A and Fuddruckers in Duncan supported the campaign by providing 10 percent of their proceeds during lunch and dinner one day to United Way of the Piedmont.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s United Way campaign extended to U.S. locations in Washington, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and North Carolina where more than $30,000 was given back to those communities. The campaign generated $267,500 in donations within five states.<br />
        <br />
