        About The Family Effect<br />
        The Family Effect is the philanthropic arm of The Phoenix Center in Greenville whose mission is to reduce addiction as the leading cause of family collapse and harm to children in upstate South Carolina. The Family Effect works to eradicate child abuse and neglect by aggressively targeting the number one root cause of these problems – addiction in the home.<br />
        <br />
        The Family Effect helps to fund programs at The Phoenix Center that identify families and children at risk, and deliver evidence-based programs to prevent family collapse and poor outcomes for the children. Phoenix Center programs supported by The Family Effect include: Serenity Place – residential treatment for pregnant women, young mothers and their preschool children; White Horse Academy – residential treatment for teenage boys, age 13 – 17; and Outpatient Treatment – effective programming for families that don’t need residential treatment.<br />
