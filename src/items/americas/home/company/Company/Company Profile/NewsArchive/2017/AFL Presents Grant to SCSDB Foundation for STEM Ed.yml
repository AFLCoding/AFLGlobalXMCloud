        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading fiber optic manufacturer and provider of services, presented $5,000 to the <a href="https://www.scsdb.org/page/344">South Carolina School for the Deaf and Blind (SCSDB) Foundation</a> designated for Einstein’s Workshop, a MakerSpace program designed to emphasize learning and exploring STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) activities. The grant is part of AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach</a> Program that focuses on STEM Education and Social Service support.<br />
         <br />
        Makerspaces can have a significant impact on student learning and development, and have been recently identified as one of the most important developments for K-12 education. They are a method for engaging learners in creative, higher-order problem solving through hands-on design, construction and repetition. Einstein’s Workshop will emphasize learning and exploring STEM activities, exposing students to new STEM concepts and giving them a hands-on learning opportunity that will help them realize their potential in the STEM fields.<br />
         <br />
        “Our Einstein’s Workshop will allow our children to experiment, take risks and explore their own ideas,” commented Ann Akerman, CEO of the SCSDB Foundation. “Our program is intended to inspire confidence in young learners and help them acquire entrepreneurial skills that are immediately applicable in the real world.”<br />
         <br />
        The SCSDB Foundation is dedicated to providing financial support to the South Carolina School for the Deaf and Blind. The mission of the school is to ensure that the children served realize maximum success through high quality educational programs, outreach services and partnerships.<br />
