        Belmont, NH and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, is a sponsor of the televised portion of the annual <a href="http://www.childrensauction.com/">LNH Children’s Auction</a> which raises funds for a number of community organizations in the central New Hampshire area. Seán Adam, general manager for AFL’s Noyes test and inspection division, presented the sponsorship funds to Denise Beauchaine, executive director for Lakes Region Public Access (LRPA), an organization that provides public access services to towns and cities. The sponsorship is made possible by AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>.<br />
        <br />
        “The annual Children’s Auction has become a major campaign in this area dedicated to improving the lives of area children in need or at risk,” commented Adam. “With early intervention and support by these organizations and programs, children who might otherwise ‘fall through the cracks’ can receive help and support from the community and, in the long run, be guided toward productive and rewarding lives.”<br />
         <br />
        Over the past 31 years, over two million dollars has been raised for local charities, all through volunteer efforts, community donations and corporate sponsorships. Nonprofit organizations that have benefited include the Salvation Army, Greater Lakes Region Santa Fund, Laconia and Gilford Police Departments Relief Family Funds, St. Vincent De Paul Children’s Foundation, Genesis Behavior Health, Appalachian Mountain Teen Project, Central NH VNA Pediatric Program, Lakes Region Child Care Services, Greater Lakes Region Child Advocacy Center, and the Health First Family Care Center, to name a few.<br />
        <br />
        The Children’s Auction is scheduled for Dec. 10-14 on LRPA, and will be televised in its entirety. Those who want to watch the auction can tune into MetroCast, channel 25, or watch online at <a href="http://www.lrpa.org/">www.lrpa.org</a>.

        Belmont, NH and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, is a sponsor of the televised portion of the annual <a href="http://www.childrensauction.com/">LNH Children’s Auction</a> which raises funds for a number of community organizations in the central New Hampshire area. Seán Adam, general manager for AFL’s Noyes test and inspection division, presented the sponsorship funds to Denise Beauchaine, executive director for Lakes Region Public Access (LRPA), an organization that provides public access services to towns and cities. The sponsorship is made possible by AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>.<br />
        <br />
        “The annual Children’s Auction has become a major campaign in this area dedicated to improving the lives of area children in need or at risk,” commented Adam. “With early intervention and support by these organizations and programs, children who might otherwise ‘fall through the cracks’ can receive help and support from the community and, in the long run, be guided toward productive and rewarding lives.”<br />
         <br />
        Over the past 31 years, over two million dollars has been raised for local charities, all through volunteer efforts, community donations and corporate sponsorships. Nonprofit organizations that have benefited include the Salvation Army, Greater Lakes Region Santa Fund, Laconia and Gilford Police Departments Relief Family Funds, St. Vincent De Paul Children’s Foundation, Genesis Behavior Health, Appalachian Mountain Teen Project, Central NH VNA Pediatric Program, Lakes Region Child Care Services, Greater Lakes Region Child Advocacy Center, and the Health First Family Care Center, to name a few.<br />
        <br />
        The Children’s Auction is scheduled for Dec. 10-14 on LRPA, and will be televised in its entirety. Those who want to watch the auction can tune into MetroCast, channel 25, or watch online at <a href="http://www.lrpa.org/">www.lrpa.org</a>.
