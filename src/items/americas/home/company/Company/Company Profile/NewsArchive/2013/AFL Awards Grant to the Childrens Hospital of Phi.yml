        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="/">AFL</a> awarded the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) with a $2,500 grant, made possible by AFL’s <a href="/Company/Community">Community Outreach Program</a>. The grant supports CHOP’s Social Work Emergency Fund which assists patients with lodging, transportation, food and medications for the uninsured/underinsured.<br />
        <br />
        “The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia continues to provide the very best pediatric care to children across the country,” said Keith Branch, senior human resources manager for AFL. “Many parents need to understand their child’s treatment, how to care for them and their siblings who may not be ill, but are going through some adjustment period. AFL’s grant supports the Children’s Hospital with this critical care.”<br />

        <br />
        “The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia has been very successful in helping patient families fulfill the needs of their sick children,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “AFL supports their endeavors, and we are grateful to have the opportunity to positively impact the lives of children and families.”<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="/">AFL</a> awarded the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) with a $2,500 grant, made possible by AFL’s <a href="/Company/Community">Community Outreach Program</a>. The grant supports CHOP’s Social Work Emergency Fund which assists patients with lodging, transportation, food and medications for the uninsured/underinsured.<br />
        <br />
        “The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia continues to provide the very best pediatric care to children across the country,” said Keith Branch, senior human resources manager for AFL. “Many parents need to understand their child’s treatment, how to care for them and their siblings who may not be ill, but are going through some adjustment period. AFL’s grant supports the Children’s Hospital with this critical care.”<br />
        <br />
        Established in 1855, The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia was the first pediatric hospital in the United States. Today, the Hospital is one the largest pediatric health care networks in the world. Children and families come from all 50 states and more than 40 countries for the most advanced pediatric care.<br />
        <br />
        “The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia has been very successful in helping patient families fulfill the needs of their sick children,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “AFL supports their endeavors, and we are grateful to have the opportunity to positively impact the lives of children and families.”<br />
        <br />
