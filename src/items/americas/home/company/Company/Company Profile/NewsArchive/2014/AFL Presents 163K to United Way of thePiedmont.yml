        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, a leading international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, presented the <a href="http://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a> with a check for $163,000. The donation was made possible by AFL associates and AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>, and was a direct result of the company’s annual <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/United-Way.aspx">United Way campaign</a>. During this three-week campaign, associates learn about United Way’s impact on local communities and become a part of that impact by giving back.<br />
        <br />
        Associate giving for the campaign exceeded AFL’s goal of $160,000 and last year’s grand total of $145,000, setting a record for AFL. With an 80’s theme titled “Let’s Go Crazy” which was tied to the company’s 30-year anniversary, the campaign built on last year’s success, and culminated with a 23 percent increase in participation and a 15 percent increase in overall associate giving.<br />
        <br />
        “This year’s goal was to educate our associates on the incredible work United Way does in our community,” said Corie Culp, AFL community relations manager. “Through agency tours and visits, speakers and events, we achieved this goal. This year’s campaign was a huge success, and we are so thankful for the dedication of our associates to impact local communities.”<br />
        <br />
        From perusing local nonprofit booths at two agency fairs to an 80’s costume contest, associates were given the opportunity to learn about local community needs through a variety of fun and informative events. The campaign included a dollar-for-dollar match for new donors, further showcasing AFL’s commitment to giving back.<br />
        <br />
        United Way is only one element of AFL’s multifaceted <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/United-Way.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>. The program also includes grants, ACT (AFL Community Team) projects, sponsorships, Take Root (a program to provide trees to communities) and disaster relief.

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, a leading international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, presented the <a href="http://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a> with a check for $163,000. The donation was made possible by AFL associates and AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>, and was a direct result of the company’s annual <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/United-Way.aspx">United Way campaign</a>. During this three-week campaign, associates learn about United Way’s impact on local communities and become a part of that impact by giving back.<br />
        <br />
        Associate giving for the campaign exceeded AFL’s goal of $160,000 and last year’s grand total of $145,000, setting a record for AFL. With an 80’s theme titled “Let’s Go Crazy” which was tied to the company’s 30-year anniversary, the campaign built on last year’s success, and culminated with a 23 percent increase in participation and a 15 percent increase in overall associate giving.<br />
        <br />
        “This year’s goal was to educate our associates on the incredible work United Way does in our community,” said Corie Culp, AFL community relations manager. “Through agency tours and visits, speakers and events, we achieved this goal. This year’s campaign was a huge success, and we are so thankful for the dedication of our associates to impact local communities.”<br />
        <br />
        From perusing local nonprofit booths at two agency fairs to an 80’s costume contest, associates were given the opportunity to learn about local community needs through a variety of fun and informative events. The campaign included a dollar-for-dollar match for new donors, further showcasing AFL’s commitment to giving back.<br />
        <br />
        United Way is only one element of AFL’s multifaceted <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/United-Way.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>. The program also includes grants, ACT (AFL Community Team) projects, sponsorships, Take Root (a program to provide trees to communities) and disaster relief.
