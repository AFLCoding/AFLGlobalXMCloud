        <p>Spartanburg, SC – In celebration of Arbor Day, <a href="/">AFL</a> donated over 600 longleaf pine trees to District Five Intermediate School students in support of its <a href="/Company/Community/Take-Root">Take Root Program</a>. The program began in 2005 when AFL had a goal to plant 5,000 trees in five years. Having exceeded this goal, AFL set another goal – to plant 12,000 trees in five more years. Sixth grade students at Berry Shoals and Beech Springs Intermediate schools in Duncan, S.C., now play a role in helping AFL accomplish this initiative.</p>
        <p>“From reducing water and electricity consumption to recycling paper and plastic, AFL takes a proactive role in being a good steward of our environment,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Our Take Root program is part of this initiative. By providing trees, we believe we are developing awareness of environmental stewardship at a young age that will continue for generations.” <br />
        <br />
        In November 2012, fifth grade students from Berry Shoals and Beech Springs Intermediate schools participated in this program, each receiving a tree to take home and plant. In addition to the donations given to students, AFL’s Take Root Program hosts events at its domestic and international locations to build awareness about our environment.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s <a href="/Company/Community">Community Outreach Program</a> supports numerous and diverse causes to include bettering communities through ACT (AFL Community Team) projects and grants, improving the environment through the Take Root Program, supporting victims of tragedy through disaster relief, and much more.<br />

        <p>Spartanburg, SC – In celebration of Arbor Day, <a href="/">AFL</a> donated over 600 longleaf pine trees to District Five Intermediate School students in support of its <a href="/Company/Community/Take-Root">Take Root Program</a>. The program began in 2005 when AFL had a goal to plant 5,000 trees in five years. Having exceeded this goal, AFL set another goal – to plant 12,000 trees in five more years. Sixth grade students at Berry Shoals and Beech Springs Intermediate schools in Duncan, S.C., now play a role in helping AFL accomplish this initiative.</p>
        <p>“From reducing water and electricity consumption to recycling paper and plastic, AFL takes a proactive role in being a good steward of our environment,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Our Take Root program is part of this initiative. By providing trees, we believe we are developing awareness of environmental stewardship at a young age that will continue for generations.” <br />
        <br />
        In November 2012, fifth grade students from Berry Shoals and Beech Springs Intermediate schools participated in this program, each receiving a tree to take home and plant. In addition to the donations given to students, AFL’s Take Root Program hosts events at its domestic and international locations to build awareness about our environment.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s <a href="/Company/Community">Community Outreach Program</a> supports numerous and diverse causes to include bettering communities through ACT (AFL Community Team) projects and grants, improving the environment through the Take Root Program, supporting victims of tragedy through disaster relief, and much more.<br />
