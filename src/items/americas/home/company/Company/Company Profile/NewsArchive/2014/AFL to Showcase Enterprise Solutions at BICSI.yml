        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an industry-leading provider of fiber optic products, engineering expertise and integrated services, is featuring an end-to-end enterprise solution in booth #818 at the <a href="https://www.bicsi.org/winter/2014/default.aspx">2014 BICSI Winter Conference and Expo</a>, Feb. 3-5 at the Rosen Shingle Creek Resort in Orlando, Fla.<br />
        <br />
        AFL and Dura-Line’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Solutions/Air-Blown-Fiber.aspx">eABF™ Air-Jetted Fiber Cabling Solution</a>, the highest fiber density solution in the market, will be demonstrated during the show. Providing an upgradeable physical pathway, the eABF solution features air-jetting qualities yet is rugged enough to comply with Telcordia’s GR-409 and NEC riser and plenum flame ratings. The eABF pathway system is comprised of Enterprise FuturePath® products and includes Indoor/Outdoor HDPE, riser, plenum and LSZH product lines.<br />
        <br />
        Demonstrations of the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers-Single-Fiber/Fujikura-70S-Fusion-Splicer.aspx">Fujikura 70S Fusion Splicer</a>, the world’s fastest fusion splicer, will also be provided. The new design streamlines the steps required to complete splices, resulting in greater productivity. With new easy-to-use features, the 70S offers a shrink time of 14 seconds.<br />
        <br />
        Also showcased will be AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/M310-Enterprise-Data-Center-Multifunction-OTDR-w-O.aspx">M310 Data Center OTDR</a> with Enhanced Event Analysis. Its high dynamic range, short dead zones and new advanced event analysis algorithm minimizes missed and false events and ensures accuracy and reliability in event analysis, taking advantage of short dead zones in data center applications.<br />
        <br />
        Designed for network growth, AFL offers its newest <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Modules-and-Panel-Accessories/Optical-Modules/Poli-MOD-Patch-and-Splice-Module.aspx">Poli-MOD</a>, a pigtailed optical interconnect patch and splice module. Accommodating up to 24 fiber interconnections in an industry-standard, single-slot LGX® 118 footprint, the Poli-MOD module uses a snap-in splice sleeve cradle that securely manages both single and ribbon fiber arrangements.<br />
