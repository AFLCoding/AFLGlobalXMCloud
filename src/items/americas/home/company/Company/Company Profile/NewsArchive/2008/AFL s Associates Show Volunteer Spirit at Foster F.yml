        <span style="background: white;">Ten volunteers from AFL along with friends and family spent time assisting with set-up, hosting the games and activities, serving food and clean up afterwards.  The volunteer effort was part of AFL ’ SPIRIT grant which matches the “sweat equity” of AFL employees with a $3,000 grant to the Spartanburg County Foster Parent Association/DSS.  Corie Culp, AFL ’ Community Relations Manager, presented the check to County Director, Ray Trail.</span><br />

Activities included a blow up slide, bounce house, Plinko, ball and ring toss, and many others, with door prizes provided at each station.  Food was plentiful as the event consisted of snow cones, popcorn, cotton candy and a large lunch of BBQ ribs and hot dogs.</span><span style="color: #333333;"><br />
        <br />
        <span style="background: white;">Ten volunteers from AFL along with friends and family spent time assisting with set-up, hosting the games and activities, serving food and clean up afterwards.  The volunteer effort was part of AFL ’ SPIRIT grant which matches the “sweat equity” of AFL employees with a $3,000 grant to the Spartanburg County Foster Parent Association/DSS.  Corie Culp, AFL ’ Community Relations Manager, presented the check to County Director, Ray Trail.</span><br />
        <br />
        <span style="background: white;">“The projects we work on never cease to amaze me,” stated Culp. “Until you have a chance to work with a non-profit organization like Foster Care of Spartanburg, and see first hand what they do for our community and our children, it is eye-opening. I applaud what the parents are doing to help our foster children, and with so much love and attention. It’s truly inspiring!”</span><br />
        <br />
        <span style="background: white;">Over 200 children are currently in foster care in Spartanburg County, but only 109 foster homes exist.
