        Spartanburg, SC - On June 9, AFL presented a $41,330 check for its annual United Way campaign to Kathy Dunleavy, President, and Monica Cothran, Campaign Director of the United Way of the Piedmont.<br />
        <br />
        AFL kicked off its campaign with a corporate contribution of $5,000 and a challenge – matching dollar for dollar all donation over last year’s employee contributions of $21K+. AFL ambassadors were recruited internally to answer questions and talk with other associates about United Way and their mission. In addition, two major fundraising events were held – one was an Agency Fair, where various agencies from both Spartanburg and Greenville where invited set up a display and talk with associates about what they do, what their needs are and how they can help. The second event was a “dunk tank lunch” in which associates were invited to dunk their favorite manager. This event alone brought in close to $2,000.<br />
        <br />
        This year’s contribution is an increase of 12% in monetary contributions and 28% in employees who contributed to the campaign. Thank you to everyone who helped with the planning of the event and to all associates for the success of this year’s campaign.<br />
