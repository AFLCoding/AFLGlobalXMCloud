Presented by the Clemson Alumni Association, the award is the highest honor that the Association bestows on an alumnus or alumna.

        <br />
        “I’m humbled and honored to receive this prestigious award alongside four additional outstanding Clemson alumni,” commented Burns. “Volunteer service has enriched my career over the years and at AFL I am fortunate to work with a company which is highly supportive of community engagement as one of its core values.”<br />
        <br />
        The award is based on three main criteria—dedication and service to Clemson University, personal and professional accomplishments and devotion to their community and public service. The nomination process is highly competitive and supports those who have given back. Of Clemson University’s 140,000 living alumni, less than 200 have been honored with this distinction.<br />

        <br />
        Burns’ legal experience spans more than 25 years. Burns most recently served with Nexsen Pruet, LLC, where he focused primarily on first chair litigation, compliance and labor and employment matters. Previously a Shareholder with Ogletree Deakins, he tried numerous cases to juries in state and federal courts and advised clients on labor, employment and contractual issues. During his career in private practice, he was recognized for excellence by publications such as The Best Lawyers in America, Super Lawyers and Martindale-Hubbell (AV).<br />
        <br />
        Burns graduated from Clemson University with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and minor in Economics.
