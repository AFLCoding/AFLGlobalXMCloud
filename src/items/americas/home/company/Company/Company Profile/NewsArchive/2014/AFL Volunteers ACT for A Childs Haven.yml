        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a> associates volunteered time at <a href="http://www.achildshaven.org/">A Child’s Haven</a> as they moved their operations from a rented five classroom space to a new 10 classroom facility large enough to accommodate 96 children, nearly doubling the number of clients they serve. A Child’s Haven provides therapeutic intervention and prevention services to children and their families who experience developmental delays as a result of abuse, neglect or poverty.<br />
        <br />
        Fifteen AFL associates, including friends and family, boxed and moved furniture and supplies from the old location to the new facility, without interrupting operations. AFL provided moving supplies and tools including over 250 boxes for packing office and classroom supplies as well as the moving truck needed to make the five-mile journey to the new location.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL’s Community Outreach Program supports initiatives such as this one where associates can step out of the workplace and serve our neighbors,” commented Brett Villiger, development engineering manager for AFL. “It’s a great opportunity for everyone involved. We gain a better understanding of the organization while helping them fulfill a need.”<br />
        <br />
        Known as an ACT (AFL Community Team), the volunteer effort qualified for an ACT grant of $3,000 which was presented during the dedication of the new building to Debbie Roche, executive director of A Child’s Haven.  <br />
        <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a> that includes grants, ACT projects, sponsorships, Take Root (a program to provide trees to communities) and disaster relief.
