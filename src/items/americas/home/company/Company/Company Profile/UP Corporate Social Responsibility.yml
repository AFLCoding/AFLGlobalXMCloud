        With operations in seven countries, AFL employs approximately 4,500 associates worldwide.&nbsp;Over the past 30+ years, AFL has seen many changes in technology, manufacturing and engineering, as well as changes across our markets and geographies around the world. We believe that AFL continues to succeed due to the strength of our associates and our core values, which drive our culture and priorities, and provide a framework in which decisions are made. AFL&rsquo;s core values are:&nbsp;Customers First;&nbsp;Integrity;&nbsp;Innovation;&nbsp;Collaboration and Accountability;&nbsp;Environment, Health and Safety; and&nbsp;Community Engagement.<br />
