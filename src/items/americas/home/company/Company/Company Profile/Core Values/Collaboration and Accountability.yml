We believe that AFL continues to succeed due to the strength of our associates and our core values, which drive our culture and priorities, and provide a framework in which decisions are made. AFL&rsquo;s core values are:&nbsp;Customers First;&nbsp;Integrity;&nbsp;Innovation;&nbsp;Collaboration and Accountability;&nbsp;Environment, Health and Safety; and&nbsp;Community Engagement.<br />
        <br />
        <h2>Customers First</h2>
        <br />
        Our company was literally built on putting the customer first. In 1984, AFL was formed to manufacture fiber optic cable for utility and telecommunications customers. After 30 years, we are still laser focused on serving our customers. Across our company, our associates are doing whatever it takes to exceed our customers&rsquo; expectations.<br />
        <br />
        <h2>Integrity</h2>
        <br />
        At AFL, we understand that people shape our culture. That's why each associate is enabled to truly make a difference. AFL drives decision-making down into the organization. We know that the best concepts and processes come from associates on the front line with strong work ethics and enthusiasm to accomplish projects with integrity.<br />
        <br />
        <h2>Innovation</h2>
        <br />
        AFL is a perennial leader when it comes to the development of innovative products across our markets. Our commercial teams work closely with our research and development teams to define new areas for product growth and development. Our commitment to innovation is exemplified in the number of patents for which we apply each year. Currently, AFL has been awarded over 100 patents.<br />
        <br />
        <h2>Collaboration and Accountability</h2>
        <br />
        AFL is dedicated to providing quality products and exceptional service and is committed to exceeding the expectations of our customers. Our goal is to first understand exactly what our customers need and work together to achieve the solution that best suits their application. Across the company, our associates are collaborating with each other to deliver solutions that improve our customers&rsquo; businesses.<br />
        <br />
        <h2>Environment, Health and Safety</h2>
        <br />
