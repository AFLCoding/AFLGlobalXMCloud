        With operations in seven countries, AFL employs approximately 4,500 associates worldwide.&nbsp;Over the past 30+ years, AFL has seen many changes in technology, manufacturing and engineering, as well as changes across our markets and geographies around the world.

AFL&rsquo;s core values are:&nbsp;Customers First;&nbsp;Integrity;&nbsp;Innovation;&nbsp;Collaboration and Accountability;&nbsp;Environment, Health and Safety; and&nbsp;Community Engagement.<br />
        <br />
        <h2>Customers First</h2>
        <br />
        Our company was literally built on putting the customer first. In 1984, AFL was formed to manufacture fiber optic cable for utility and telecommunications customers. After 30 years, we are still laser focused on serving our customers. Across our company, our associates are doing whatever it takes to exceed our customers&rsquo; expectations.<br />
        <br />
        <h2>Integrity</h2>
        <br />
        At AFL, we understand that people shape our culture. That's why each associate is enabled to truly make a difference. AFL drives decision-making down into the organization. We know that the best concepts and processes come from associates on the front line with strong work ethics and enthusiasm to accomplish projects with integrity.<br />
        <br />
        <h2>Innovation</h2>
        <br />
        AFL is a perennial leader when it comes to the development of innovative products across our markets.

        <br />
        <h2>Collaboration and Accountability</h2>
        <br />
        AFL is dedicated to providing quality products and exceptional service and is committed to exceeding the expectations of our customers. Our goal is to first understand exactly what our customers need and work together to achieve the solution that best suits their application. Across the company, our associates are collaborating with each other to deliver solutions that improve our customers&rsquo; businesses.<br />
        <br />
        <h2>Environment, Health and Safety</h2>
        <br />
        AFL has a long and proven history of focusing on the health and safety of our workforce and the preservation of the environment for the benefit of communities today and future generations.
