        <div>Monroe, NC and Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a provider of services and manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, presented a $5,000 grant to&nbsp;<a href="https://turningpointnc.org/about-us/mission/">Turning Point</a>, Inc. based in Monroe, North Carolina, for its Domestic Violence Program. Funding provided by AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&amp;_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>&nbsp;will support the children&rsquo;s program.<br />
        &ldquo;While domestic violence is a crime whose victims are largely women and children, it is regarded as a substantial public health problem with multiple and serious consequences,&rdquo; explained Denise Davis, Director of Turning Point&rsquo;s Domestic Violence Program. &ldquo;With grants such as the one received from AFL, we are able to serve victims and their families with the goal of stopping the violence before it begins.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        Turning Point is the only program in Union County that provides services to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and child sexual and physical abuse. Its children&rsquo;s program consists of referrals, parent education and an educational based-group counseling program called HERO, specifically designed for child observers of domestic violence ages 3 &ndash; 18.<br />
        <br />
        In 2018, Turning Point expanded its children&rsquo;s program to most junior and senior high schools in Union County including alternative schools for at-risk youth and colleges by teaching HERO and the Teen Dating Violence Prevention Program which addresses the dynamics of teen dating violence from ages 12-18. The goal of these programs is to stop violence before it begins by teaching students the signs of abuse, healthy verses unhealthy relationships and tools on how to express their anger without violence. In 2019, Turning Point started the &ldquo;Hope to Overcome&rdquo; program which provides HERO and the Teen Dating Violence programs to incarcerated youth.<br />

        <div>Monroe, NC and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a provider of services and manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, presented a $5,000 grant to <a href="https://turningpointnc.org/about-us/mission/">Turning Point</a>, Inc. based in Monroe, North Carolina, for its Domestic Violence Program. Funding provided by AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> will support the children’s program.<br />
        “While domestic violence is a crime whose victims are largely women and children, it is regarded as a substantial public health problem with multiple and serious consequences,” explained Denise Davis, Director of Turning Point’s Domestic Violence Program. “With grants such as the one received from AFL, we are able to serve victims and their families with the goal of stopping the violence before it begins.”<br />
        <br />
        Turning Point is the only program in Union County that provides services to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and child sexual and physical abuse. Its children’s program consists of referrals, parent education and an educational based-group counseling program called HERO, specifically designed for child observers of domestic violence ages 3 – 18.<br />
        <br />
        In 2018, Turning Point expanded its children’s program to most junior and senior high schools in Union County including alternative schools for at-risk youth and colleges by teaching HERO and the Teen Dating Violence Prevention Program which addresses the dynamics of teen dating violence from ages 12-18. The goal of these programs is to stop violence before it begins by teaching students the signs of abuse, healthy verses unhealthy relationships and tools on how to express their anger without violence. In 2019, Turning Point started the “Hope to Overcome” program which provides HERO and the Teen Dating Violence programs to incarcerated youth.<br />
