        <br />
        Kent, WA and Spartanburg, SC &ndash; June 10, 2019 &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3ACE1DA2BD41439D95F451A80754116B&amp;_z=z">AFL Hyperscale</a>, a manufacturer of end-to-end connectivity solutions for data center, telecom and enterprise networks, and&nbsp;Light Brigade, AFL&rsquo;s training and education division, supported several local nonprofits this spring through AFL&rsquo;s Community Outreach Program. United Way of King County, Vision House and Northwest Harvest were recipients of funding and volunteer efforts.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        AFL Hyperscale and Light Brigade took part in AFL&rsquo;s annual worldwide giving campaign called &ldquo;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E4E2803881E7472E8F43A3451FDD6B90&amp;_z=z">Imagine That!</a>&rdquo; by raising more than $20,000 to support the community through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uwkc.org/">United Way of King County</a>. The annual employee fundraiser helps build a community where students graduate, families are financially stable, and people have homes.Through AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&amp;_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>, donations were matched dollar-for-dollar up to $100 and for those new to the United Way campaign, donations were matched dollar-for-dollar with no limit.<br />
        <br />
        Both companies also presented $2,500 in grants to&nbsp;<a href="https://visionhouse.org/">Vision House</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.northwestharvest.org/">Northwest Harvest</a>&nbsp;as part of AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;Community Outreach Program, which supports social service programs for children and STEM education. A $1,250 grant was presented to Vision House, an organization that helps families move from the crisis and trauma of homelessness to stability and self-sufficiency in King County, WA. The grant will support Vision House&rsquo;s transitional housing program that provides families a place to rebuild their lives and learn new life skills. Northwest Harvest received a $1,250 grant to support its Year-round Children's Nutrition Initiative. The initiative focuses on childhood hunger and school readiness and will serve more than 11,000 children this year in King County, WA.<br />
        <br />
        Several Light Brigade team members also donated time to volunteer at Vision House&rsquo;s No Homeless Kids Benefit Lunch on May 7, in Bellevue, WA. Volunteers assisted with pre-event setup, post-event clean-up and had the opportunity to attend the inspiring luncheon that raised more than $450,000 to assist families experiencing homelessness.<br />
        <br />
        AFL Hyperscale and Light Brigade are actively involved in making a difference in the lives of their neighbors. Throughout the year, team members join together to make a positive impact in their community through volunteer activities and fundraising initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        AFL has an extensive&nbsp;Community Outreach Program&nbsp;that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more.<br />

        <br />
        Kent, WA and Spartanburg, SC – June 10, 2019 – <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3ACE1DA2BD41439D95F451A80754116B&_z=z">AFL Hyperscale</a>, a manufacturer of end-to-end connectivity solutions for data center, telecom and enterprise networks, and Light Brigade, AFL’s training and education division, supported several local nonprofits this spring through AFL’s Community Outreach Program. United Way of King County, Vision House and Northwest Harvest were recipients of funding and volunteer efforts. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        AFL Hyperscale and Light Brigade took part in AFL’s annual worldwide giving campaign called “<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E4E2803881E7472E8F43A3451FDD6B90&_z=z">Imagine That!</a>” by raising more than $20,000 to support the community through <a href="https://www.uwkc.org/">United Way of King County</a>. The annual employee fundraiser helps build a community where students graduate, families are financially stable, and people have homes.Through AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>, donations were matched dollar-for-dollar up to $100 and for those new to the United Way campaign, donations were matched dollar-for-dollar with no limit.<br />
        <br />
        Both companies also presented $2,500 in grants to <a href="https://visionhouse.org/">Vision House</a> and <a href="https://www.northwestharvest.org/">Northwest Harvest</a> as part of AFL’s Community Outreach Program, which supports social service programs for children and STEM education. A $1,250 grant was presented to Vision House, an organization that helps families move from the crisis and trauma of homelessness to stability and self-sufficiency in King County, WA. The grant will support Vision House’s transitional housing program that provides families a place to rebuild their lives and learn new life skills. Northwest Harvest received a $1,250 grant to support its Year-round Children's Nutrition Initiative. The initiative focuses on childhood hunger and school readiness and will serve more than 11,000 children this year in King County, WA.<br />
        <br />
        Several Light Brigade team members also donated time to volunteer at Vision House’s No Homeless Kids Benefit Lunch on May 7, in Bellevue, WA. Volunteers assisted with pre-event setup, post-event clean-up and had the opportunity to attend the inspiring luncheon that raised more than $450,000 to assist families experiencing homelessness.<br />
        <br />
        AFL Hyperscale and Light Brigade are actively involved in making a difference in the lives of their neighbors. Throughout the year, team members join together to make a positive impact in their community through volunteer activities and fundraising initiatives.     <br />
        AFL has an extensive Community Outreach Program that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more.<br />
