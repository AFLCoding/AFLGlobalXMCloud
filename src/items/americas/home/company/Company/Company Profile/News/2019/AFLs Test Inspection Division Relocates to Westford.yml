        <div>Westford, MA and Spartanburg, SC – June 12, 2019 – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, announces that its <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=67697A36EE374C21A1F009672463F0E6&_z=z">Test and Inspection</a> Division expanded and relocated from the Lowell, MA office to Westford, MA, allowing AFL to continue its growth strategy via workforce and technical innovation.
        <br />
        “A strong commitment by the state to the integrated photonics sector has created a vibrant ecosystem and talent pipeline that is critical to our current and future success,” commented Dave LeBlanc, general manager of AFL’s Test & Inspection Division. “This pipeline will help fuel our strategy for continued growth.”<br />
        <br />

        <br />
