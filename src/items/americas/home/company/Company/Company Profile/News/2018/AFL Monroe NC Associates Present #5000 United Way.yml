        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer and provider of services, concluded its annual United Way campaign and presented a $5,000 donation to <a href="https://uwcentralcarolinas.org/">United Way of Central Carolinas</a>. Made possible by associates and AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>, this year’s donation doubled over last year’s.  <br />
        <br />
        “Our associates understand the need in our community and demonstrated their willingness to take action to help others,” commented Seneca Mullins, title here. “They were definitely engaged and it showed in this donation. We hope to continue this progress for years to come.”  <br />
        <br />
        This year’s United Way campaign theme was “Lights. Camera. Take Action.” Associates heard from a United Way representative and learned about the organizations United Way supports through its program. Through AFL’s Community Outreach Program, donations were matched dollar-for-dollar up to $100 and for those new to the United Way campaign, donations were matched dollar-for-dollar with no limit.  <br />
        <br />
        AFL locations in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, South Carolina and Washington participated in the campaign which generated $325,000 in the United States. AFL locations internationally also supported the annual campaign, culminating in a $352,000 donation to communities worldwide.<br />
        <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more.

Take Action.” Associates heard from a United Way representative and learned about the organizations United Way supports through its program. Through AFL’s Community Outreach Program, donations were matched dollar-for-dollar up to $100 and for those new to the United Way campaign, donations were matched dollar-for-dollar with no limit.  <br />
        <br />
        AFL locations in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, South Carolina and Washington participated in the campaign which generated $325,000 in the United States. AFL locations internationally also supported the annual campaign, culminating in a $352,000 donation to communities worldwide.<br />
