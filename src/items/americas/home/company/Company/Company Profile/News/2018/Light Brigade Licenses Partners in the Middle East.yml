        Tukwila, WA and Spartanburg, SC – Light Brigade, the training and education division of AFL, recently licensed three new training partners in the Middle East. Bright Wires in Saudi Arabia, Lantern Electricals Trading LLC, and Oman Fiber Optic in Oman now offer Light Brigade’s FTTx for Installers and Technicians training course. Each of these partners completed a rigorous “Train-the Trainer” program to ensure that their instructors have the technical knowledge and teaching expertise needed to deliver the training to the high standards that those in the industry have come to expect from Light Brigade.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/LightBrigade_Sq_CMYK.aspx" target="_blank"></a>“With the explosion of fiber and FTTx build-outs in the region, we needed to have local presence to service training requests,” explained Lee Kellett, general manager of Light Brigade. “We are so fortunate to be working with partners that are already very knowledgeable and rooted in the fiber optic space.”<br />
        <br />
        Technicians who complete this FTTx training will better understand the materials, tools and equipment needed as well as be versed in the industry’s “best practices” for installation, testing and troubleshooting.  The right training assures that costly mistakes will be avoided and projects will be completed efficiently.<br />
        <br />
        Kellett continued, “The availability of certified training opportunities means that local service providers and contractors can now easily prepare their staff for FTTx/FTTH buildouts.” <br />
        <br />
        All students will qualify for Light Brigade certification and have the opportunity to complete the ETA International FOT-OSP (Outside Plant) certification exam. Classes in the UAE, Oman and Saudi Arabia will be scheduled soon and also available by special request.<br />

        Tukwila, WA and Spartanburg, SC – Light Brigade, the training and education division of AFL, recently licensed three new training partners in the Middle East. Bright Wires in Saudi Arabia, Lantern Electricals Trading LLC, and Oman Fiber Optic in Oman now offer Light Brigade’s FTTx for Installers and Technicians training course. Each of these partners completed a rigorous “Train-the Trainer” program to ensure that their instructors have the technical knowledge and teaching expertise needed to deliver the training to the high standards that those in the industry have come to expect from Light Brigade.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/LightBrigade_Sq_CMYK.aspx" target="_blank"></a>“With the explosion of fiber and FTTx build-outs in the region, we needed to have local presence to service training requests,” explained Lee Kellett, general manager of Light Brigade. “We are so fortunate to be working with partners that are already very knowledgeable and rooted in the fiber optic space.”<br />
        <br />
        Technicians who complete this FTTx training will better understand the materials, tools and equipment needed as well as be versed in the industry’s “best practices” for installation, testing and troubleshooting.  The right training assures that costly mistakes will be avoided and projects will be completed efficiently.<br />
        <br />
        Kellett continued, “The availability of certified training opportunities means that local service providers and contractors can now easily prepare their staff for FTTx/FTTH buildouts.” <br />
        <br />
        All students will qualify for Light Brigade certification and have the opportunity to complete the ETA International FOT-OSP (Outside Plant) certification exam. Classes in the UAE, Oman and Saudi Arabia will be scheduled soon and also available by special request.<br />
