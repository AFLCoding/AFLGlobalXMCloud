        <p>Monroe, NC and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> awarded a $2,500 grant to <a href="https://www.unionshelter.org/">Union County Community Shelter</a>, an organization that provides food, emergency shelter and instruction to individuals and families in need within the community. The  will support the Emergency Shelter and Food program which provides emergency shelter services to homeless men, women and children, rehousing services to move people from homelessness back to permanent housing, and free feeding services through the soup kitchen and food pantry program.</p>

        “It is our intent to help very low income people attain a place of stability in which they can propel their lives out of a survival mentality to a pathway to stability, even prosperity—now and generationally,” said Kathy Bragg, CEO of Union County Community Shelter (UCCS). “We have great community support, a strong volunteer presence and a mission that others wish to support.”<br />
         <br />
        <a href="https://www.unionshelter.org/">Union County Community Shelter</a> exists to serve homeless men, women and children in Union County, and also anyone in Union County experiencing a food hardship. UCCS assists people in poverty who are experiencing homelessness by providing emergency shelter and a rapid rehousing program. The shelter promotes a pathway to self-sufficiency which includes income stabilization and permanent housing.<br />
         <br />
        Bragg continued, “We are striving to put an end to episodic homelessness before it turns chronic.”<br />
         <br />
        The shelter cares for those with food security needs by providing meals three times a day, seven days a week through their soup kitchen and food pantry. After meeting basic needs of food and shelter, the shelter uses a case management “coaching” approach, affordable permanent housing access, and twelve month post housing support access to strive to provide a permanent solution to end homelessness, family instability, and hunger. <br />

        “It is our intent to help very low income people attain a place of stability in which they can propel their lives out of a survival mentality to a pathway to stability, even prosperity—now and generationally,” said Kathy Bragg, CEO of Union County Community Shelter (UCCS). “We have great community support, a strong volunteer presence and a mission that others wish to support.”<br />
         <br />
        <a href="https://www.unionshelter.org/">Union County Community Shelter</a> exists to serve homeless men, women and children in Union County, and also anyone in Union County experiencing a food hardship. UCCS assists people in poverty who are experiencing homelessness by providing emergency shelter and a rapid rehousing program. The shelter promotes a pathway to self-sufficiency which includes income stabilization and permanent housing.<br />
         <br />
        Bragg continued, “We are striving to put an end to episodic homelessness before it turns chronic.”<br />
         <br />
        The shelter cares for those with food security needs by providing meals three times a day, seven days a week through their soup kitchen and food pantry. After meeting basic needs of food and shelter, the shelter uses a case management “coaching” approach, affordable permanent housing access, and twelve month post housing support access to strive to provide a permanent solution to end homelessness, family instability, and hunger. <br />
