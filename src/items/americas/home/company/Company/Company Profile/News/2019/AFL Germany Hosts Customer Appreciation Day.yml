        About AFL Germany<br />
        Kabelwerke Rheydt was founded in 1898 and by 1910 copper telecommunication cables were being manufactured. Nearly 70 years later, the organization was manufacturing optical fibre cables including metallic overhead lines and initiated optical fibre drawing operations several years later. In 1991, Kabelwerke Rheydt started manufacturing overhead lines with fibres in stainless steel tubes. The company transitioned into French ALCATEL S.A. in 1992 and in 2000 became NEXANS S.A. In 2004, Dutch DRAKA assumed the fibre business from ALCATEL and in 2009 America Fujikura Ltd (AFL) acquired DRAKA&acute;s business segment &ldquo;Optical Aerial Cables&rdquo; and founded AFL Telecommunications GmbH, GERMANY, with 120 employees.<br />

        About AFL Germany<br />
        Kabelwerke Rheydt was founded in 1898 and by 1910 copper telecommunication cables were being manufactured. Nearly 70 years later, the organization was manufacturing optical fibre cables including metallic overhead lines and initiated optical fibre drawing operations several years later. In 1991, Kabelwerke Rheydt started manufacturing overhead lines with fibres in stainless steel tubes. The company transitioned into French ALCATEL S.A. in 1992 and in 2000 became NEXANS S.A. In 2004, Dutch DRAKA assumed the fibre business from ALCATEL and in 2009 America Fujikura Ltd (AFL) acquired DRAKA&acute;s business segment &ldquo;Optical Aerial Cables&rdquo; and founded AFL Telecommunications GmbH, GERMANY, with 120 employees.<br />
