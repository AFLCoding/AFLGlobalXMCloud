        Swindon, UK and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fibre optic cable and accessories, presented a $4,000 <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">community outreach</a> grant to <a href="https://thandananihouse.wordpress.com/">Thandanani House of Refuge</a>, an organisation that works within the Zandspruit Informal Settlement in Johannesburg, South Africa to provide support for abused, neglected and orphaned children. The grant supports the refurbishment needed in the homes of these children.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/Thandananai_PR.aspx" target="_blank"></a>“The Thandanani House of Refuge was set up by a committee of volunteers who became aware of a growing number of children in the Zandspruit community who were in desperate need of shelter and support,” commented Ian Chard, Project Services Manager at AFL in EMEA. “The community the refuge supports is a settlement of 70,000 shack dwellers. Some of the children from this area are facing real difficulties through lack of family support. The Thandanani House is a safe and positive environment where the children can go.”<br />
        <br />
        Thandanani House of Refuge was established in 2001 and has been supporting children in need of shelter since 2003. The Refuge aims to provide a home for young lives from broken backgrounds and give them renewed hope for the future.<br />
        <br />
        “Within the walls of the House of Refuge, lives are being changed, hope renewed, dreams re-discovered and authentic love experienced,” said DP McKibbin, Chairman of Thandanani House of Refuge. “We are so thankful to AFL and its associates for this grant as it meant we are able to carry out some much needed refurbishments to the communal areas in both the boys and girls houses.”<br />

        Swindon, UK and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fibre optic cable and accessories, presented a $4,000 <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">community outreach</a> grant to <a href="https://thandananihouse.wordpress.com/">Thandanani House of Refuge</a>, an organisation that works within the Zandspruit Informal Settlement in Johannesburg, South Africa to provide support for abused, neglected and orphaned children. The grant supports the refurbishment needed in the homes of these children.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/Thandananai_PR.aspx" target="_blank"></a>“The Thandanani House of Refuge was set up by a committee of volunteers who became aware of a growing number of children in the Zandspruit community who were in desperate need of shelter and support,” commented Ian Chard, Project Services Manager at AFL in EMEA. “The community the refuge supports is a settlement of 70,000 shack dwellers. Some of the children from this area are facing real difficulties through lack of family support. The Thandanani House is a safe and positive environment where the children can go.”<br />
        <br />
        Thandanani House of Refuge was established in 2001 and has been supporting children in need of shelter since 2003. The Refuge aims to provide a home for young lives from broken backgrounds and give them renewed hope for the future.<br />
        <br />
        “Within the walls of the House of Refuge, lives are being changed, hope renewed, dreams re-discovered and authentic love experienced,” said DP McKibbin, Chairman of Thandanani House of Refuge. “We are so thankful to AFL and its associates for this grant as it meant we are able to carry out some much needed refurbishments to the communal areas in both the boys and girls houses.”<br />
        <br />
