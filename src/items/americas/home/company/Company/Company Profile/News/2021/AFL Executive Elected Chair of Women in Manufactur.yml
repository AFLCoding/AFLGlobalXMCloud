        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, welcomes 14 students from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spart5.net/bhs">Byrnes High School</a>&nbsp;into its Operational Workforce Program. Through a partnership with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sccsc.edu/">Spartanburg Community College</a>&nbsp;(SCC), the training program offers students an introduction to manufacturing. Classes are provided by SCC professors at Byrnes High School.<br />
        <br />
        AFL launched the Operational Workforce Program in early 2018 and have since fully employed nine students who graduated from the program.<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;Through classroom theory and practical on-the-job scenarios, students gain a better understanding of manufacturing in today&rsquo;s environment,&rdquo; explained Ryan Burns, human resources director for AFL. &ldquo;They are part of the manufacturing experience, gaining insight into operations (production, shipping and receiving, and quality) from beginning to end.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        AFL began operations in Spartanburg County in 1984, manufacturing Optical Ground Wire, a fiber optic cable found on transmission lines. Since then AFL has expanded its product portfolio to include additional fiber optic cable, connectors, fiber management systems, test and inspection equipment, education, training, services and more. AFL employs more than 1,000 associates in the Upstate, and more than 5,000 associates worldwide.<br />
