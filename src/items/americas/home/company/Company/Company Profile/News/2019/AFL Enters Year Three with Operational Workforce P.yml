        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories is continuing its Operational Workforce Program into 2020 with 14 students from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spart5.net/BHS">Byrnes High School</a>&nbsp;joining the program in January. Through a partnership with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sccsc.edu/">Spartanburg Community College</a>&nbsp;(SCC), the training program will offer these students an introduction to manufacturing. Classes are provided by SCC professors at Byrnes High School.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;With competition for a talented workforce at an all-time high, this program provides an entrance point for our younger generation,&rdquo; commented Ryan Burns, human resources director for AFL. &ldquo;We are able to train students who are eager to learn about manufacturing and jumpstart their career.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        AFL pioneered the first Operational Workforce Program in early 2018 and have since fully employed six students who graduated from the program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Burns continued, &ldquo;The training we provide also creates an awareness of who we are, the impact we have in our markets, with our customers and in our community.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        AFL began operations in Spartanburg County in 1984, manufacturing Optical Ground Wire, a fiber optic cable found on transmission lines. Since then AFL has expanded its product portfolio to include additional fiber optic cable, connectors, fiber management systems, test and inspection equipment, education, training, services and more.<br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories is continuing its Operational Workforce Program into 2020 with 14 students from <a href="https://www.spart5.net/BHS">Byrnes High School</a> joining the program in January. Through a partnership with <a href="https://www.sccsc.edu/">Spartanburg Community College</a> (SCC), the training program will offer these students an introduction to manufacturing. Classes are provided by SCC professors at Byrnes High School.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        “With competition for a talented workforce at an all-time high, this program provides an entrance point for our younger generation,” commented Ryan Burns, human resources director for AFL. “We are able to train students who are eager to learn about manufacturing and jumpstart their career.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL pioneered the first Operational Workforce Program in early 2018 and have since fully employed six students who graduated from the program.    <br />
        <br />
        Burns continued, “The training we provide also creates an awareness of who we are, the impact we have in our markets, with our customers and in our community.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL began operations in Spartanburg County in 1984, manufacturing Optical Ground Wire, a fiber optic cable found on transmission lines. Since then AFL has expanded its product portfolio to include additional fiber optic cable, connectors, fiber management systems, test and inspection equipment, education, training, services and more.<br />
