        Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, presented a $2,500 grant to <a href="http://www.projectlearninc.org/">Project LEARN</a>, an organization that partners with Lowell Public Schools, community partners and local business to acquire funding, leverage resources and develop programs that enrich the educational system and prepare students with the skills and innovative thinking needed to succeed and become life-long learners. The grant will support the <a href="http://www.projectlearninc.org/what_we_do/initiatives/">Lowell Loves to Learn BookNook Program</a>.<br />
        <br />
        Project LEARN has partnered with the Lowell Early Childhood Advisory Council (LECAC) to provide resources and programs to help improve the support for children ages 0 through eight through the Lowell Loves to Learn initiative. The overarching goals of Lowell Loves to Learn are to increase access to early childhood education; increase kindergarten readiness; foster a love of learning at an early age; and connect low income families to high quality early education programs across the city.<br />
        <br />
        “At the heart of school readiness is literacy,” commented LZ Nunn, executive director of Project Learn. “We partner with cultural groups and community organizations that serve our city’s most under-served populations. Due to constraints with things like transportation and childcare, many local families do not have easy access to services like the public library or summer playgrounds offered by public schools. We aim to bring these resources directly into the neighborhoods and in ways that are accessible to all.”<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8FB5A255996547FE823D84B0C00D891C&_z=z">grant from AFL</a> will provide the ability to install an additional five BookNooks, expand the BookNook program by bringing the mobile BookNook to eight community events, provide translation support for multi-lingual outreach materials, create monthly Lowell Loves to Learn e-newsletters and a year-round social media campaign, and hire a project intern to assist with the management of project growth, communications, volunteer coordination and event coordination.<br />
