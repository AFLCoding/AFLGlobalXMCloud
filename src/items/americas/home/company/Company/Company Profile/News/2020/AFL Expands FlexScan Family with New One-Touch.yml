        <div>Westford, MA and Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, has added a new category to its award-winning FlexScan product line.

        </ul>
        &nbsp;<br />
        &ldquo;PON networks have become the global fiber technology of choice to deliver on the exploding demand for bandwidth,&rdquo; noted Arun Jain, director of marketing for AFL's equipment business. &ldquo;The global pandemic poured gasoline onto the fire as millions of people started to work, learn and socialize from home. Service providers at every level are being challenged to meet this need using their current workforce which may not be familiar with fiber and advanced optical testing tools such as OTDRs. They need simple intuitive tools that they can deploy with little, if any, training. Our existing FlexScan products are easy-to-use, and the&nbsp;FlexScan TS100&nbsp;takes it to the next level with one-touch troubleshooting.&rdquo;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        Michael Scholten, senior product manager for AFL added, &ldquo;The FlexScan TS100 is a game changer for service providers deploying and maintaining PON networks. The TS100 empowers frontline technicians, who are not allowed or not qualified to use OTDRs, to perform a single-ended test in under three seconds. Recommended corrective actions are provided with link and fault measurements, turning every tech into a troubleshooting expert.&rdquo;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        The&nbsp;FlexScanTS100&nbsp;is designed to meet the real-world needs of customers. It offers a dual-wavelength PON power meter option to verify both GPON and XGS-PON networks. The field-replaceable UPC or APC connector can be swapped out if the end-face becomes damaged from connection to dirty or damaged patch cords, eliminating costly and time-consuming factory repairs.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        The FlexScan TS100 is available in a variety of kits which add a choice of launch cables,&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=ADEF956603AE457D9BB13FEF51ECB804&amp;_z=z">cleaning supplies</a>, and&nbsp;FOCIS Flex connector inspection&nbsp;probe and tips.

Service providers at every level are being challenged to meet this need using their current workforce which may not be familiar with fiber and advanced optical testing tools such as OTDRs. They need simple intuitive tools that they can deploy with little, if any, training. Our existing FlexScan products are easy-to-use, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRs-and-Troubleshooters/FlexScan-TS100-FTTH-PON-Troubleshooter.aspx">FlexScan TS100</a>&nbsp;takes it to the next level with one-touch troubleshooting.&rdquo;<br />

        Michael Scholten, senior product manager for AFL added, &ldquo;The FlexScan TS100 is a game changer for service providers deploying and maintaining PON networks. The TS100 empowers frontline technicians, who are not allowed or not qualified to use OTDRs, to perform a single-ended test in under three seconds. Recommended corrective actions are provided with link and fault measurements, turning every tech into a troubleshooting expert.&rdquo;<br />

        <div>Westford, MA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, has added a new category to its award-winning FlexScan product line. The new <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AB973208EAD1411A8148C998A95E324E&_z=z">FlexScan TS100</a> is an optical troubleshooter that puts the power to identify, locate and resolve last mile network issues in the pocket of frontline field technicians. With just a push of a button, the TS100 enables even novice technicians to troubleshoot PON and point-to-point networks like an expert.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRs-and-Troubleshooters/FlexScan-TS100-FTTH-PON-Troubleshooter.aspx">TS100</a> includes many of the popular features that are hallmarks of the FlexScan family:<br />
         <br />
        <ul>
            <li>Rugged, pocket-sized package, instant On, and 12-hour battery life</li>
            <li>LinkMap® color-coded icon-based view of the tested network</li>
            <li>Corrective action identification to fix any issues found</li>
            <li>Large gesture-recognition touchscreen display – no stylus needed</li>

            <li>Bluetooth® interface to AFL’s award-winning <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1BEBC639211A4C13AD2F33C6424FF63B&_z=z">FOCIS connector inspection</a> products</li>
            <li>Integrated PON and broadband power meters, light source and VFI</li>
        </ul>
         <br />
        “PON networks have become the global fiber technology of choice to deliver on the exploding demand for bandwidth,” noted Arun Jain, director of marketing for AFL's equipment business. “The global pandemic poured gasoline onto the fire as millions of people started to work, learn and socialize from home. Service providers at every level are being challenged to meet this need using their current workforce which may not be familiar with fiber and advanced optical testing tools such as OTDRs. They need simple intuitive tools that they can deploy with little, if any, training. Our existing FlexScan products are easy-to-use, and the FlexScan TS100 takes it to the next level with one-touch troubleshooting.”<br />
         <br />
        Michael Scholten, senior product manager for AFL added, “The FlexScan TS100 is a game changer for service providers deploying and maintaining PON networks. The TS100 empowers frontline technicians, who are not allowed or not qualified to use OTDRs, to perform a single-ended test in under three seconds. Recommended corrective actions are provided with link and fault measurements, turning every tech into a troubleshooting expert.”<br />
         <br />
        The FlexScanTS100 is designed to meet the real-world needs of customers. It offers a dual-wavelength PON power meter option to verify both GPON and XGS-PON networks. The field-replaceable UPC or APC connector can be swapped out if the end-face becomes damaged from connection to dirty or damaged patch cords, eliminating costly and time-consuming factory repairs.<br />
         <br />
        The FlexScan TS100 is available in a variety of kits which add a choice of launch cables, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=ADEF956603AE457D9BB13FEF51ECB804&_z=z">cleaning supplies</a>, and FOCIS Flex connector inspection probe and tips.
