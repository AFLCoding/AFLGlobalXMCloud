Operation Santa SC collects each child’s size, age, grade, and some information about their personality so that they can purchase items personalized to each child.<br />
        <br />
        “We want each child to feel the love from the school and community and enjoy the experience of receiving gifts at Christmas time,” said Kathy Sheppard from Operation Santa SC. “Studies show that a child who is comfortably and appropriately dressed, meaning shoes that fit and clothing that is seasonably suitable, will have more self-confidence and be better prepared to be successful.”<br />
        <br />
        Operation Santa became Operation Santa SC Inc. (501c(3)) in 2011 and helped 70 children at Christmas that year. In 2018 they supported 784 children.<br />
