        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash; July 8, 2019 &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, was recognized by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a>&nbsp;with three awards at its annual meeting and awards presentation. AFL was the recipient of the top award for Employee Giving (for companies at $200K+) and set a record by giving back more than $397,000 to upstate communities, earning it a new award never received by another organization&mdash;the Game Changer Award&mdash;for increasing employee donations by 42 percent.
        &ldquo;Our associates stepped up again this year to make a difference in our community,&rdquo; commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. &ldquo;Through community engagement, they truly grasp the need and understand how pulling together resources can change lives.&rdquo;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        This year&rsquo;s United Way campaign theme was titled &ldquo;Game On!&rdquo; and provided fun and inspiration through various gaming themes. Through campaign meetings associates learned about the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hopecfc.org/">Hope Center for Children</a>&nbsp;(HCFC), an organization that builds stable, healthy families and provides children a safe place from abuse and neglect. HCFC was highlighted through a video and personal story from an AFL associate. The goal of campaign meetings is to help associates understand the impact United Way has on nonprofit organizations and their ability to serve the community.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        Culp continued, &ldquo;Associates alone provided $306,000 to the community&mdash;these are personal donations&mdash;and with AFL&rsquo;s match, we were close to $400,000. Next year we hope to move past the $400K mark to continue impacting children and families and helping our community thrive!&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        While the number of associates donating through this campaign grew by 10 percent, associates in Spartanburg increased their personal gift to United Way by 42 percent. Leadership donors, those contributing $1,000 or more, nearly doubled year-over-year.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        All AFL US locations, including South Carolina, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington, supported local United Way organizations, generating $475,000. Locations internationally also supported the annual campaign, donating to various local organizations chosen by associates, and increased the financial impact to $509,000 worldwide, marking a 44 percent increase in giving worldwide over last year&rsquo;s campaign.<br />
        <br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC – July 8, 2019 – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, was recognized by <a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a> with three awards at its annual meeting and awards presentation. AFL was the recipient of the top award for Employee Giving (for companies at $200K+) and set a record by giving back more than $397,000 to upstate communities, earning it a new award never received by another organization—the Game Changer Award—for increasing employee donations by 42 percent.
        “Our associates stepped up again this year to make a difference in our community,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Through community engagement, they truly grasp the need and understand how pulling together resources can change lives.”<br />
         <br />
        This year’s United Way campaign theme was titled “Game On!” and provided fun and inspiration through various gaming themes. Through campaign meetings associates learned about the <a href="http://www.hopecfc.org/">Hope Center for Children</a> (HCFC), an organization that builds stable, healthy families and provides children a safe place from abuse and neglect. HCFC was highlighted through a video and personal story from an AFL associate. The goal of campaign meetings is to help associates understand the impact United Way has on nonprofit organizations and their ability to serve the community.<br />
         <br />
        Culp continued, “Associates alone provided $306,000 to the community—these are personal donations—and with AFL’s match, we were close to $400,000. Next year we hope to move past the $400K mark to continue impacting children and families and helping our community thrive!”   <br />
         <br />
        While the number of associates donating through this campaign grew by 10 percent, associates in Spartanburg increased their personal gift to United Way by 42 percent. Leadership donors, those contributing $1,000 or more, nearly doubled year-over-year.<br />
         <br />
        All AFL US locations, including South Carolina, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington, supported local United Way organizations, generating $475,000. Locations internationally also supported the annual campaign, donating to various local organizations chosen by associates, and increased the financial impact to $509,000 worldwide, marking a 44 percent increase in giving worldwide over last year’s campaign.<br />
        <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more.
