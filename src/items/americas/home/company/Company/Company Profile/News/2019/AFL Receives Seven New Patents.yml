Seventeen associates were recognized over the past two quarters. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <ol>
            <li>A method to apply an aluminum coating layer to the core of copper wire;</li>
            <li>A composite micro-cable optimized to be jetted into the existing coax cable sheaths after the core had been extracted;</li>
            <li>An optical fiber furcation transition assembly that accepts a variety of flat drop fiber optic cables;</li>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A8D6DBB08D15403FB2E3BFAEAB1A95D2&amp;_z=z">PoliMOD&reg;</a>, a field-installable optical module with configurable cable attachment.</li>
        </ol>
        The&nbsp;Accessories&nbsp;division was the recipient of two patents:<br />
        <ol>
            <li>A Swage high voltage cable terminal which eliminates the deviation-prone additive method and expands upon a tried-and-true process from the transmission product line with the resultant profile and product finish being naturally Corona-free at high voltages, removing the need for tedious manual processing of the terminal.</li>
            <li>Flat Drop Cable Tangent accessory that provides a means of suspending flat drop cables used in Fiber-to-the-Home applications.</li>
        </ol>
        The&nbsp;Test and Inspection&nbsp;division received a patent for an OTDR merging technique for traces captured by using different settings. This technique features a shorter laser pulse that can produce traces of more accurate location information, and a longer pulse that produces traces with less noise for a more reliable result.<br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=CB5A0B73F40540109C53688EDA61E0F7&_z=z">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, recognized several associates who received patents for developing new products and technologies within the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E545E2A90D414F31BDD0BA9B8ED27FD0&_z=z">cable</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&_z=z">connectivity</a> division, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DD697FB3AFEA42B2B976EB9288D04701&_z=z">accessories</a>, and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=67697A36EE374C21A1F009672463F0E6&_z=z">test and inspection</a> division. Seventeen associates were recognized over the past two quarters.  <br />
        <br />
        <ol>
            <li>A method to apply an aluminum coating layer to the core of copper wire;</li>
            <li>A composite micro-cable optimized to be jetted into the existing coax cable sheaths after the core had been extracted;</li>
            <li>An optical fiber furcation transition assembly that accepts a variety of flat drop fiber optic cables;</li>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A8D6DBB08D15403FB2E3BFAEAB1A95D2&_z=z">PoliMOD®</a>, a field-installable optical module with configurable cable attachment.</li>
        </ol>
        The Accessories division was the recipient of two patents:<br />
        <ol>
            <li>A Swage high voltage cable terminal which eliminates the deviation-prone additive method and expands upon a tried-and-true process from the transmission product line with the resultant profile and product finish being naturally Corona-free at high voltages, removing the need for tedious manual processing of the terminal.</li>
            <li>Flat Drop Cable Tangent accessory that provides a means of suspending flat drop cables used in Fiber-to-the-Home applications.</li>
        </ol>
        The Test and Inspection division received a patent for an OTDR merging technique for traces captured by using different settings. This technique features a shorter laser pulse that can produce traces of more accurate location information, and a longer pulse that produces traces with less noise for a more reliable result.<br />
