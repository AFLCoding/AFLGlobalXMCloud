        <p>Each year, AFL awards a four-year scholarship to the son or daughter of a North American-based AFL associate entering a college or university. The scholarship was named in memory of Toshihide Naruse, Managing Director of Fujikura, AFL&rsquo;s parent company. Mr. Naruse&rsquo;s contributions to AFL were significant, and because of his personal interest in higher education, AFL continues to honor his memory.</p>
