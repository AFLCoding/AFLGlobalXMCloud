        Most recently, AFL launched the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8A47BDB2CFCC486D80AB31035D7593D0&_z=z">Operational Workforce Program</a>. We are working with current high school students seeking to gain manufacturing certificates and join our immediate production workforce after graduation. AFL partners with local community colleges to build apprentice programs where trade students gain classroom knowledge simultaneously working part time to gain on the job maintenance and technical experience.<br />

        <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=42FDC709BA964169AF29F0445E1F59A1&_z=z">Environment, Health & Safety</a> is one of AFL’s Core Values. AFL has comprehensive EHS policies and procedures that aim to go well above and beyond standards compliance. Our approach involves a continuous improvement model utilizing internal and external auditing and actively engaged employees who are encouraged and incentivized to identify and report hazards they observe in our workplaces.<br />
