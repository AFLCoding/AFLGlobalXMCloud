        <div>Swindon, U.K. and Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories located in Swindon, UK, presented a &pound;460 grant to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prospect-hospice.net/">Prospect Hospice</a>&nbsp;for its annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/ACT-Project.aspx">Volunteers Choose</a>&nbsp;program. The grant was the result of a vote by AFL associates who volunteered during the previous year.<br />
        &ldquo;Without the support of our volunteers and organisations such AFL, we just couldn&rsquo;t provide the range and quality of services we do for our local community,&rdquo; explained Lisa Curtis, corporate fundraiser for Prospect Hospice. &ldquo;Volunteering works both ways, however, and it is so important to us that our volunteers know that they are making a vital contribution and are fulfilling their reasons for giving up their time.&rdquo;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        AFL Swindon associates are actively involved with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prospect-hospice.net/">Prospect Hospice</a>, an organisation whose vision is for excellent,&nbsp;personalized and compassionate care for everyone affected by a life-limiting illness. During the 2018/2019 year, AFL associates helped raise &pound;2,092 (including the recent grant) through a number of fundraising activities including cake sales, an Easter egg collection, Christmas raffle fund donations, stock sorting at their retail distribution centre and payroll giving. That amount is equivalent to eight full night shifts of Prospect@Home nurses, giving huge reassurance for patients and their families; 26 patient assessments made by the therapy team; 104 complementary therapies to help lift patients up and enhance their well-being. Since 2001, AFL has raised approximately &pound;7,590 for this organisation.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        Lisa continued, &ldquo;Being voted for &lsquo;best volunteering experience&rsquo; by the employees of AFL, out of all the volunteering opportunities, is such an honour and it means we are getting it right for those people who generously donate their precious time. We are genuinely thrilled to receive such an accolade and the cheque for &pound;460&mdash;a big bonus for winning the vote. Our grateful thanks goes out to all the employees who voted and to AFL for all their support.&rdquo;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        Fiona Hill, community outreach coordinator for AFL also commented, &ldquo;Our associates recognise the valuable work of Prospect Hospice to provide care and support in the community. They are an asset to their clients and we are excited to be able to provide additional funding for their efforts.&rdquo;<br />

        <div>Swindon, U.K. and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories located in Swindon, UK, presented a £460 grant to <a href="https://www.prospect-hospice.net/">Prospect Hospice</a> for its annual <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/ACT-Project.aspx">Volunteers Choose</a> program. The grant was the result of a vote by AFL associates who volunteered during the previous year.<br />
        “Without the support of our volunteers and organisations such AFL, we just couldn’t provide the range and quality of services we do for our local community,” explained Lisa Curtis, corporate fundraiser for Prospect Hospice. “Volunteering works both ways, however, and it is so important to us that our volunteers know that they are making a vital contribution and are fulfilling their reasons for giving up their time.”<br />
         <br />
        AFL Swindon associates are actively involved with <a href="https://www.prospect-hospice.net/">Prospect Hospice</a>, an organisation whose vision is for excellent, personalized and compassionate care for everyone affected by a life-limiting illness. During the 2018/2019 year, AFL associates helped raise £2,092 (including the recent grant) through a number of fundraising activities including cake sales, an Easter egg collection, Christmas raffle fund donations, stock sorting at their retail distribution centre and payroll giving. That amount is equivalent to eight full night shifts of Prospect@Home nurses, giving huge reassurance for patients and their families; 26 patient assessments made by the therapy team; 104 complementary therapies to help lift patients up and enhance their well-being. Since 2001, AFL has raised approximately £7,590 for this organisation.<br />
         <br />
        Lisa continued, “Being voted for ‘best volunteering experience’ by the employees of AFL, out of all the volunteering opportunities, is such an honour and it means we are getting it right for those people who generously donate their precious time. We are genuinely thrilled to receive such an accolade and the cheque for £460—a big bonus for winning the vote. Our grateful thanks goes out to all the employees who voted and to AFL for all their support.”<br />
         <br />
        Fiona Hill, community outreach coordinator for AFL also commented, “Our associates recognise the valuable work of Prospect Hospice to provide care and support in the community. They are an asset to their clients and we are excited to be able to provide additional funding for their efforts.”<br />
