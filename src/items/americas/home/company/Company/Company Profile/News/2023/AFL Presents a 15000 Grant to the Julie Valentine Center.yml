        <p>Spartanburg,  S.C. | April 11, 2023 | <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> continues to  be an advocate for Life Enrichment and Advancement Programs (LEAP) with its  $15,000 grant to the <a href="https://www.julievalentinecenter.org/">Julie Valentine Center (JVC),</a> an organization that supports sexual  assault and child abuse survivors in the upstate. LEAP, one of AFL&rsquo;s key focus  areas, supports individuals pursuing employment and self-sufficiency. Made  possible through AFL&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Company/Community">Community  Outreach program</a>, this  grant will support the production of a new education and development video  aimed to change the conditions that contribute to child abuse and sexual  assault in the community. </p>
        <p>For  over 40 years, JVC has provided free, confidential services to victims of sexual  assault and child abuse. JVC works to stop child  abuse and sexual assault before it happens, reduce trauma and re-establish  safety for victims and their families.</p>
        <p>In  an effort to expand its outreach program, JVC used the funds provided by AFL to  produce a short video aimed to educate the community about the conditions that  contribute to rampant child abuse and sexual assault. The vivid production  skillfully produced by <a href="https://upperwest.agency/">Upper West Creative</a> in Greenville, will serve as the foundation of the  outreach program, with a focus on donor cultivation, community outreach and  education. Watch the full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGNPt_bHulU">video</a> here.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Our  mission is to stop sexual violence and child abuse and the impact of these  crimes through prevention, investigation, collaboration, treatment and  advocacy,&rdquo; Stacey Karesh, Director of Philanthropy explained. &ldquo;Through visual  storytelling, we hope to increase knowledge and dispel myths and misconceptions  about sexual assault and child abuse.&rdquo; </p>
        <p>AFL has a robust <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a> that includes grants, sponsorships, environmental  initiatives, disaster relief and more.
