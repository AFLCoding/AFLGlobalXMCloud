To extend these opportunities to all children in the community, TCMU offers three scholarship programs that provide museum access at low or no cost: Upstate Play Partners, Title I field trips and Museums for All. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Specifically geared towards families in priority zip codes, TCMU's scholarship programs allow the museum to create, deliver and provide accessible exhibits and programming for all children and families in the Upstate community. Scholarship visits give children direct access to play-based learning experiences &ndash; that they may otherwise be unable to participate in without TCMU.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">&ldquo;We recognize the need for increased exposure for all children to STEM-related fields, and TCMU works to provide unique and memorable experiences for children to experience foundational experiences rooted in STEM-based learning,&rdquo; said Bethany Kern, Director of Development at TCMU</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Located in both Greenville and Spartanburg, TCMU is committed to meeting each community&rsquo;s need for accessible STEM educational opportunities outside of the classroom, based on an informed view of systemic challenges facing local residents.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">&ldquo;Just like TCMU strives to break barriers for families in the community, funding from AFL will help remove a financial barrier and allow the museum to expand its impact and support families that need it most,&rdquo; continued Kern. &ldquo;Our hope is that this early exposure will inspire children to pursue STEM education, and eventually, related careers."</span></p>
