        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, a leading global fiber optic cable and accessories manufacturer, presented a $7,500 check to the <a href="https://www.redcross.org/">American Red Cross</a> in support of disaster relief in areas affected by Hurricane Florence. The grant was made possible by AFL associates and AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>.</p>
        <div>
        “This disaster relief support is unique to our associates because those affected by Florence are right here in the Carolina communities that we are a part of,” stated Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “This was an opportunity for us to serve our local community by helping people to get back on their feet after the devastation many experienced.”  <br />
        <br />
        The American Red Cross and other organizations have provided more than 126,000 overnight stays in emergency shelters across the Carolinas in the aftermath of this storm. Nearly three weeks after Florence hit, there were still more than eight hundred people staying in shelters in the Carolinas. Red Cross disaster workers are serving countless hours to shelter, feed, and support people affected.<br />
        <br />
        Hurricane Florence caused extensive damage to communities primarily in the Carolinas. The storm was a Category 4 hurricane right up until landfall, when it weakened to a Category 1. It moved slowly over the Carolinas, resulting in continuous heavy rainfall and consistently high winds. Florence dumped an average of 17.5 inches of rain on the Carolinas, but upward of thirty-five inches in some places. Fifty lives were claimed as a result, and millions of lives were disrupted. It was estimated that the storm costs are totaling from $16 billion to $20 billion, with a majority of those costs being in the Carolinas.<br />

        “This disaster relief support is unique to our associates because those affected by Florence are right here in the Carolina communities that we are a part of,” stated Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “This was an opportunity for us to serve our local community by helping people to get back on their feet after the devastation many experienced.”  <br />
        <br />
        The American Red Cross and other organizations have provided more than 126,000 overnight stays in emergency shelters across the Carolinas in the aftermath of this storm. Nearly three weeks after Florence hit, there were still more than eight hundred people staying in shelters in the Carolinas. Red Cross disaster workers are serving countless hours to shelter, feed, and support people affected.<br />
        <br />
        Hurricane Florence caused extensive damage to communities primarily in the Carolinas. The storm was a Category 4 hurricane right up until landfall, when it weakened to a Category 1. It moved slowly over the Carolinas, resulting in continuous heavy rainfall and consistently high winds. Florence dumped an average of 17.5 inches of rain on the Carolinas, but upward of thirty-five inches in some places. Fifty lives were claimed as a result, and millions of lives were disrupted. It was estimated that the storm costs are totaling from $16 billion to $20 billion, with a majority of those costs being in the Carolinas.<br />
