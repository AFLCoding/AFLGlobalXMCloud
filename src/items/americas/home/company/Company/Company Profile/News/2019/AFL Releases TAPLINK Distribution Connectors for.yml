        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash; June 17, 2019 &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of transmission, substation and distribution accessories, plus fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment,&nbsp;is launching a new family of&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6CD173DCC58345FB96AB18FA89D7A0A8&amp;_z=z">TAPLINK wedge connectors</a>.&nbsp;Used to tap a conductor to a main line distribution power line, this product line is unique in that the clamps do not require special tools whereas other wedge-type products do. AFL&rsquo;s TAPLINK product line consists of the following connectors:<br />
        <ul>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5F6B73495DF84E4B9F83392B6A5BA2E7&amp;_z=z">Wedge tap connectors</a>&nbsp;&ndash; used to make complete aluminum-to-aluminum and aluminum-to-copper electrical connections.</li>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1877ABEF8BE34E20AA4B355D2A4C4B43&amp;_z=z">Wedge pad tap connectors</a>&nbsp;&ndash; used to connect various NEMA devices to aluminum and copper conductors.</li>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=273546F10AD74228AFC706600D7D85A7&amp;_z=z">Wedge stirrup connectors</a>&nbsp;&ndash; designed to protect the conductor from damage caused by arcing in applications where hotline clamps are attached.</li>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=45E98207CA884940B9343192CFA0266D&amp;_z=z">Hotline connectors</a>&nbsp;&ndash; designed for hotline applications, this connector can be removed and reused as desired as a temporary or permanent connection.
            </li>
        </ul>
        &ldquo;Wedge connectors are unique in their ability to hold continuous pressure on the conductors during thermal cycling,&rdquo; explained Jon Potter, commercial manager for AFL's accessories division.<br />
        <br />
        The special wedge configuration leads to quicker installation times and provides superior performance as compared to standard bolted or compression type products.&nbsp;The connectors are easy to remove using a standard socket wrench without risking damage to the conductor. Additionally, the shearhead bolt concept provides installation consistency, taking human error out of the equation.<br />
        <br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC – June 17, 2019 – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of transmission, substation and distribution accessories, plus fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, is launching a new family of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6CD173DCC58345FB96AB18FA89D7A0A8&_z=z">TAPLINK wedge connectors</a>. Used to tap a conductor to a main line distribution power line, this product line is unique in that the clamps do not require special tools whereas other wedge-type products do. AFL’s TAPLINK product line consists of the following connectors:<br />
        <ul>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5F6B73495DF84E4B9F83392B6A5BA2E7&_z=z">Wedge tap connectors</a> – used to make complete aluminum-to-aluminum and aluminum-to-copper electrical connections.</li>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1877ABEF8BE34E20AA4B355D2A4C4B43&_z=z">Wedge pad tap connectors</a> – used to connect various NEMA devices to aluminum and copper conductors.</li>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=273546F10AD74228AFC706600D7D85A7&_z=z">Wedge stirrup connectors</a> – designed to protect the conductor from damage caused by arcing in applications where hotline clamps are attached.</li>
            <li><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=45E98207CA884940B9343192CFA0266D&_z=z">Hotline connectors</a> – designed for hotline applications, this connector can be removed and reused as desired as a temporary or permanent connection.
            </li>
        </ul>
        “Wedge connectors are unique in their ability to hold continuous pressure on the conductors during thermal cycling,” explained Jon Potter, commercial manager for AFL's accessories division.<br />
        <br />
        The special wedge configuration leads to quicker installation times and provides superior performance as compared to standard bolted or compression type products. The connectors are easy to remove using a standard socket wrench without risking damage to the conductor. Additionally, the shearhead bolt concept provides installation consistency, taking human error out of the equation.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s accessories division excels on the experience gained from over 80 years designing and manufacturing accessory products. For additional information on AFL, its products and services, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
