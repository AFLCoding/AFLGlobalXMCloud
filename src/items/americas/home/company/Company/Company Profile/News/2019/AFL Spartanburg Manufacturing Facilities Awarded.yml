        <div>Spartanburg, SC&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and hardware, earned five&nbsp;<a href="https://myscma.com/">South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance</a>&nbsp;(SCMA) Plant Safety Awards for its manufacturing locations in Spartanburg, South Carolina. These awards are given to facilities that have days away, restricted or transferred (DART) rates below the national published manufacturing averages.<br />
        OSHA&rsquo;s DART rate is an indicator of the most serious types of injury cases. It takes into account any injuries that required work restrictions, days away from work and any work where the associate is transferred to another role or area in order for them to be able to work post-injury. AFL&rsquo;s Spartanburg facilities&rsquo; average DART rate over the past three years has been at least 50 percent lower than the national published manufacturing average.<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;At AFL, nothing is more important than sending our associates home in a condition that is at least as good as when they came to work,&rdquo; commented Jason Chevallard, senior EHS (Environment, Health &amp; Safety) manager at AFL. &ldquo;Our people do a great job reporting hazards so that they can be addressed before they cause incidents. We continually strive to keep our associates safe and healthy&mdash;it&rsquo;s a benefit to them and their families, to AFL and our community.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        The facilities receiving this award manufacture&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E545E2A90D414F31BDD0BA9B8ED27FD0&amp;_z=z">fiber optic cable</a>,&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DD697FB3AFEA42B2B976EB9288D04701&amp;_z=z">accessories</a>,&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&amp;_z=z">connectivity</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=55E85DE502FD4DF7A029245253934A91&amp;_z=z">fusion splicers</a>&nbsp;and operate in highly industrial environments. Receiving this award in five Spartanburg facilities is a significant accomplishment for AFL&rsquo;s associates. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        "The companies who earn this award are held to very high standards," said Sara Hazzard, president &amp; CEO of the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance (SCMA). "Strong company cultures recognize that their most valuable assets are their associates and that safe working environments is a collaborative and constant necessity every day.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        The SCMA is the only statewide organization dedicated exclusively to the interests of manufacturers. Its mission is to elevate the quality of life for all South Carolinians by advancing the state&rsquo;s manufacturing industry. AFL is an active member of SCMA. More than 100 South Carolina companies were recognized with safety awards by SCMA this year.<br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC  – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and hardware, earned five <a href="https://myscma.com/">South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance</a> (SCMA) Plant Safety Awards for its manufacturing locations in Spartanburg, South Carolina. These awards are given to facilities that have days away, restricted or transferred (DART) rates below the national published manufacturing averages.<br />
        OSHA’s DART rate is an indicator of the most serious types of injury cases. It takes into account any injuries that required work restrictions, days away from work and any work where the associate is transferred to another role or area in order for them to be able to work post-injury. AFL’s Spartanburg facilities’ average DART rate over the past three years has been at least 50 percent lower than the national published manufacturing average.<br />
        <br />
        “At AFL, nothing is more important than sending our associates home in a condition that is at least as good as when they came to work,” commented Jason Chevallard, senior EHS (Environment, Health & Safety) manager at AFL. “Our people do a great job reporting hazards so that they can be addressed before they cause incidents. We continually strive to keep our associates safe and healthy—it’s a benefit to them and their families, to AFL and our community.”<br />
        <br />
        The facilities receiving this award manufacture <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E545E2A90D414F31BDD0BA9B8ED27FD0&_z=z">fiber optic cable</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DD697FB3AFEA42B2B976EB9288D04701&_z=z">accessories</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&_z=z">connectivity</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=55E85DE502FD4DF7A029245253934A91&_z=z">fusion splicers</a> and operate in highly industrial environments. Receiving this award in five Spartanburg facilities is a significant accomplishment for AFL’s associates.  <br />
        <br />
        "The companies who earn this award are held to very high standards," said Sara Hazzard, president & CEO of the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance (SCMA). "Strong company cultures recognize that their most valuable assets are their associates and that safe working environments is a collaborative and constant necessity every day.”<br />
        <br />
        The SCMA is the only statewide organization dedicated exclusively to the interests of manufacturers. Its mission is to elevate the quality of life for all South Carolinians by advancing the state’s manufacturing industry. AFL is an active member of SCMA. More than 100 South Carolina companies were recognized with safety awards by SCMA this year.<br />
