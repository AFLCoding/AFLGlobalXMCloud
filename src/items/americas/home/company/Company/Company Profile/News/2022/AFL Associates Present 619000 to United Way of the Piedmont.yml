        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span>Spartanburg, SC – July 11, 2022 – </span><a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">AFL</span></a><span>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and accessories, completed its annual United Way campaign by presenting $619,000 to </span><a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">United Way of the Piedmont</span></a><span>. The donation was made possible by AFL associates and AFL’s </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Company/Community"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Community Outreach</span></a><span> program which strives to make a positive difference in the lives of others. The campaign marked a 25 percent increase over the previous year with an 18 percent increase in the number of associates who donated. </span></p>
        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span>This year, AFL’s campaign theme was “</span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Company/Community#giving"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Imagine That!</span></a><span>” which also happens to be the program name worldwide. Associates were asked to “Imagine a better community” and commit to make a difference. Donations were matched dollar-for-dollar up to $100 for all donors, and an unlimited match for donors new to the campaign. AFL locations around the world conducted campaigns during the month of May and generated $776,000 for AFL communities. This is a 16 percent increase over 2021 and a 13 percent increase in the number of donors globally. </span></p>
        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span>“AFL is an amazing community partner! I’ve never seen an organization live into their Core Values like AFL,” commented Paige Stephenson, President and CEO of United Way of the Piedmont. “They are a model for community engagement. Their support of the community through their United Way workplace campaign will definitely ensure that everyone has the opportunity to thrive.”</span></p>
        <p style="line-height: 115%;"><span>AFL also recently received the Large Business Partner of the Year award from United Way of the Piedmont. This award goes to a company with 100 or more employees and takes into consideration total campaign giving, average gift, per capita gift, undesignated giving, participation rate and company intangibles such as committed top-down leadership, excellent campaign management, company culture of philanthropy, and board/donor group participation. </span></p>

By 2030, its goal is to decrease the number of individuals living below self-sufficiency by 11,000. As part of their work in education, financial stability and health, United Way of the Piedmont is committed to ensuring that the programs invested in, and the outcomes generated are equitable. </span></p>
