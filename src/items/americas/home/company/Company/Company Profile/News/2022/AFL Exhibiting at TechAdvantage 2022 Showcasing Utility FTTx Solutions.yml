        Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, an industry-leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment, and accessories, is exhibiting at the <a href="https://www.cooperative.com/conferences-education/meetings/techadvantage/Pages/expo-information.aspx">2022 Tech Advantage Conference and Expo</a> in Nashville, TN, March 7 &ndash; 9 at the Music City Center. Follow the Power&reg; to booth #2019 for a tour of AFL&rsquo;s utility FTTx network solution and to learn how these solutions reduce installation time and overall costs. Featured products will include the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BD16F0851A334911A1C25E3194A9D166&amp;_z=z">Apex&reg; splice closure</a>, the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1C02FEF0BA5045378E031A27C560D9EB&amp;_z=z">TITAN RTD&reg; fiber terminal</a>&nbsp;featuring <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6B7BB7C698E34CFB98ACAB5B01BD0DBF&amp;_z=z">AFL TRIDENT&reg;</a>&nbsp;hardened fiber optic connectors, plus conductor accessories like the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6CD173DCC58345FB96AB18FA89D7A0A8&amp;_z=z">TAPLINK&trade;</a>&nbsp;distribution connectors&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=356C8F8F83944494ADAAA7E1F8BC8FD6&amp;_z=z">Solo HD&trade; compression</a>.<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/apex">Apex splice closure</a> is designed to lower overall installation time with easier to use sealing and cable retention methods, along with industry-leading density, especially when coupled with AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/High-Density/OSP-MicroCore/LM-Series-OSP-MicroCore-Blown-Fiber-Cables.aspx">MicroCore&reg;</a>&nbsp;cable or&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=700FA7F356564DF8AA34C82971BFE193&amp;_z=z">Wrapping Tube Cable using SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg;</a>.&nbsp;Field installers and engineers can perform 1,728 splices inside of a 20-inch-long dome or 3,456 splices inside a 25-inch-long dome. With an easy-to-use wedge-based gel sealing system, installation time is drastically decreased as network reliability increases.&nbsp;<br />

        The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1C02FEF0BA5045378E031A27C560D9EB&amp;_z=z">AFL TITAN RTD&reg; Multiport</a>&nbsp;factory-terminated OSP fiber terminal is designed for quick and easy subscriber connections anywhere in the OSP network when used in conjunction with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1C02FEF0BA5045378E031A27C560D9EB&amp;_z=z">AFL TRIDENT&reg;</a>&nbsp;Hardened Fiber Optic Connectors. The sealed and rugged design allow for long term reliability when installed anywhere in the network&mdash;underground, in pedestals, on poles, or on aerial strand or ADSS cables.<br />
        <br />
        Two of AFL&rsquo;s newest hardware accessories will be showcased at TechAdvantage. TAPLINK&trade; distribution connectors for conductors and Solo HD&trade; compression accessories. Both products were designed to reduce installation time.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Distribution-Accessories/Wedge-clamps.aspx">TAPLINK</a> wedge connectors are used to tap a conductor to a main line distribution power line. The clamps do not require special tools. Its wedge design leads to faster installation times and provides superior performance as compared to standard bolted products. The product line consists of wedge tap connectors, wedge pad tap connectors, wedge stirrup connectors and hotline connectors.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=356C8F8F83944494ADAAA7E1F8BC8FD6&amp;_z=z">Solo HD</a>&nbsp;is a compression product line designed to improve field installation practices and reduce installation time. The one-die system uses an innovative core gripping system that allows a single die to compress the outer aluminum barrel, gripping the steel core and aluminum strands while using the same die set. The result ultimately cuts installation time in half.&nbsp;<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, an industry-leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment, and accessories, is exhibiting at the <a href="https://www.cooperative.com/conferences-education/meetings/techadvantage/Pages/expo-information.aspx">2022 Tech Advantage Conference and Expo</a> in Nashville, TN, March 7 – 9 at the Music City Center. Follow the Power® to booth #2019 for a tour of AFL’s utility FTTx network solution and to learn how these solutions reduce installation time and overall costs. Featured products will include the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BD16F0851A334911A1C25E3194A9D166&_z=z">Apex® splice closure</a>, the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1C02FEF0BA5045378E031A27C560D9EB&_z=z">TITAN RTD® fiber terminal</a> featuring <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6B7BB7C698E34CFB98ACAB5B01BD0DBF&_z=z">AFL TRIDENT®</a> hardened fiber optic connectors, plus conductor accessories like the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6CD173DCC58345FB96AB18FA89D7A0A8&_z=z">TAPLINK™</a> distribution connectors  and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=356C8F8F83944494ADAAA7E1F8BC8FD6&_z=z">Solo HD™ compression</a>.<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/apex">Apex splice closure</a> is designed to lower overall installation time with easier to use sealing and cable retention methods, along with industry-leading density, especially when coupled with AFL’s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/High-Density/OSP-MicroCore/LM-Series-OSP-MicroCore-Blown-Fiber-Cables.aspx">MicroCore®</a> cable or <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=700FA7F356564DF8AA34C82971BFE193&_z=z">Wrapping Tube Cable using SpiderWeb Ribbon®</a>. Field installers and engineers can perform 1,728 splices inside of a 20-inch-long dome or 3,456 splices inside a 25-inch-long dome. With an easy-to-use wedge-based gel sealing system, installation time is drastically decreased as network reliability increases. <br />
        <br />
        The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1C02FEF0BA5045378E031A27C560D9EB&_z=z">AFL TITAN RTD® Multiport</a> factory-terminated OSP fiber terminal is designed for quick and easy subscriber connections anywhere in the OSP network when used in conjunction with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1C02FEF0BA5045378E031A27C560D9EB&_z=z">AFL TRIDENT®</a> Hardened Fiber Optic Connectors. The sealed and rugged design allow for long term reliability when installed anywhere in the network—underground, in pedestals, on poles, or on aerial strand or ADSS cables.<br />
        <br />
        Two of AFL’s newest hardware accessories will be showcased at TechAdvantage. TAPLINK™ distribution connectors for conductors and Solo HD™ compression accessories. Both products were designed to reduce installation time.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Distribution-Accessories/Wedge-clamps.aspx">TAPLINK</a> wedge connectors are used to tap a conductor to a main line distribution power line. The clamps do not require special tools. Its wedge design leads to faster installation times and provides superior performance as compared to standard bolted products. The product line consists of wedge tap connectors, wedge pad tap connectors, wedge stirrup connectors and hotline connectors.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=356C8F8F83944494ADAAA7E1F8BC8FD6&_z=z">Solo HD</a> is a compression product line designed to improve field installation practices and reduce installation time. The one-die system uses an innovative core gripping system that allows a single die to compress the outer aluminum barrel, gripping the steel core and aluminum strands while using the same die set. The result ultimately cuts installation time in half. <br />
        <br />
