        “As splicing productivity expectations continue to increase, these new models address many issues that have historically slowed the process,” explained Greg Pickeral, product line manager for AFL’s Fusion Splicing Systems. “The improved sheath clamp design of the 90S and the field replaceable v-grooves in the 90R address the most common causes for production delays during splicing. Productivity gains of 50 percent have been achieved with the 90S alone.”<br />
