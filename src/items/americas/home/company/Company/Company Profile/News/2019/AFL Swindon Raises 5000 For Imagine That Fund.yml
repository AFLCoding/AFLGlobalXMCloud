        “Community Engagement is one of our Core Values and throughout this campaign, our associates showed us how they were living it,” said Fiona Hill, community outreach coordinator for AFL Europe. “Their passion to help others was evident.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL's annual Imagine That! campaign engages and educates associates around the world about the needs in the community. During the campaign, associates are asked to consider making a personal financial contribution. <br />
        <br />
