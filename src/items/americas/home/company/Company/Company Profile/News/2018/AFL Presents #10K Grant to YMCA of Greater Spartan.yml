        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> awarded a $10,000 grant to the <a href="http://www.spartanburgymca.org/">YMCA of Greater Spartanburg</a> for its annual scholarship campaign which serves children and families in the Spartanburg region. Made possible by AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>, the grant will support the YMCA’s summer camp program for children and the cancer survivorship program.  <br />
        <br />
        The YMCA Childcare program consists of <a href="http://www.spartanburgymca.org/summer-day-camp.php">Summer Day Camp</a>, <a href="http://www.spartanburgymca.org/afterschool-program.php">After School</a>, <a href="http://www.spartanburgymca.org/childwatch.php">Childwatch</a> and free drop-in care programs for young children, specifically ages six through 12. Summer Day Camp is a weekly program that includes educational games, field trips, tutoring and more for children. Similarly, the Afterschool Program includes a structured, nurturing environment for children to receive tutoring if needed and time to complete their homework. The cancer survivorship program, called <a href="https://www.livestrong.org/what-we-do/program/livestrong-at-the-ymca">LIVESTRONG® at the YMCA</a> and through a partnership with the Livestrong Foundation, gives assistance to cancer survivors in their recovery, physically and mentally.<br />
        <br />
        “Our programs, like the Afterschool and Summer Day Camp, have shown academic and social improvements in the children who attend,” said David Ozmore, branch executive manager for the YMCA of Greater Spartanburg. “Similarly, the Cancer survivorship program allows patients to grow at their own pace but also gives them the opportunity to bond with other survivors. This can improve their physical and mental state. The grant provided by AFL will support both of these programs and enable families take part in activities at the YMCA.”<br />
        <br />
        The YMCA of Greater Spartanburg has served Spartanburg County since 1869.
