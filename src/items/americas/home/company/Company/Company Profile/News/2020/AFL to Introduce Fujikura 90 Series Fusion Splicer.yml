Visit AFL in booth #831 to see our newest product releases including the&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2E8A1E84DF684525BB00EFB67133746A&amp;_z=z">Fujikura 90S/R Fusion Splicers</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DB44898475AB4B0B9D36E60964EFD850&amp;_z=z">ASCEND</a>&reg; platform with new cassettes and the&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B307C1531CEE49B9BEDD0BD35F8B61BB&amp;_z=z">ROGUE&reg; OLTS Certifier</a>, among other products.<br />
        <br />
        The&nbsp;90S single fiber fusion splicer&nbsp;and&nbsp;90R ribbon fusion splicer&nbsp;are designed to maximize productivity in the field and minimize downtime for routine maintenance. The&nbsp;Fujikura 90S&nbsp;features a new multi-function sheath clamp which incorporates an innovative dual clamping capability that enables proper clamping of loose jacketed 900 &micro;m without the need to exchange the sheath clamp. New fiber retention clamps also secure the completed splice in the v-grooves to enable quicker application of the protection sleeve and transfer to the sleeve heater. The&nbsp;Fujikura 90R&nbsp;is provided with a spare 12-fiber v-groove and electrode assembly which can be quickly exchanged in the field to address silica buildup and contamination issues. &nbsp;
        AFL is also showcasing its&nbsp;ASCEND&nbsp;platform, a modular, high-density rack-mount solution designed for data center applications. New to this platform are the Conversion Cassettes, Tap Cassettes and WDM Cassettes.&nbsp;The Conversion Cassette provides a quick solution to transition from one BASE platform to another. The Tap Cassette offers easy access points for monitoring live signals. And the WDM Cassette enables the expansion of fiber bandwidth in CWDM or DWDM applications.&nbsp;Stop by and experience these new cassettes which add unique options for modularity and fiber flexibility within the ASCEND platform.<br />
        <br />
        AFL will also feature its&nbsp;ROGUE OLTS Certifier, a test set designed for both enterprise network operators and telecom service providers working in environments ranging from data centers to LANs, access, metro and core networks. The design features a test port on each of the paired units that measures insertion loss, return loss and length bi-directionally to industry standards on multimode or single-mode networks. This allows certification of both enterprise networks and single-fiber circuits often found in optical access networks connecting homes and businesses.<br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=CB5A0B73F40540109C53688EDA61E0F7&_z=z">AFL</a>, an industry-leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment, and accessories, is exhibiting at the <a href="https://www.bicsi.org/conferences-and-events/bicsi-events/conferences-exhibitions/2020-winter-conferences">BICSI Winter Conference and Exhibition</a> in Tampa, February 9 - 13. Visit AFL in booth #831 to see our newest product releases including the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2E8A1E84DF684525BB00EFB67133746A&_z=z">Fujikura 90S/R Fusion Splicers</a>, the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DB44898475AB4B0B9D36E60964EFD850&_z=z">ASCEND</a>® platform with new cassettes and the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B307C1531CEE49B9BEDD0BD35F8B61BB&_z=z">ROGUE® OLTS Certifier</a>, among other products.<br />
        <br />
        The 90S single fiber fusion splicer and 90R ribbon fusion splicer are designed to maximize productivity in the field and minimize downtime for routine maintenance. The Fujikura 90S features a new multi-function sheath clamp which incorporates an innovative dual clamping capability that enables proper clamping of loose jacketed 900 µm without the need to exchange the sheath clamp. New fiber retention clamps also secure the completed splice in the v-grooves to enable quicker application of the protection sleeve and transfer to the sleeve heater. The Fujikura 90R is provided with a spare 12-fiber v-groove and electrode assembly which can be quickly exchanged in the field to address silica buildup and contamination issues.  
        AFL is also showcasing its ASCEND platform, a modular, high-density rack-mount solution designed for data center applications. New to this platform are the Conversion Cassettes, Tap Cassettes and WDM Cassettes. The Conversion Cassette provides a quick solution to transition from one BASE platform to another. The Tap Cassette offers easy access points for monitoring live signals. And the WDM Cassette enables the expansion of fiber bandwidth in CWDM or DWDM applications. Stop by and experience these new cassettes which add unique options for modularity and fiber flexibility within the ASCEND platform.<br />
        <br />
        AFL will also feature its ROGUE OLTS Certifier, a test set designed for both enterprise network operators and telecom service providers working in environments ranging from data centers to LANs, access, metro and core networks. The design features a test port on each of the paired units that measures insertion loss, return loss and length bi-directionally to industry standards on multimode or single-mode networks. This allows certification of both enterprise networks and single-fiber circuits often found in optical access networks connecting homes and businesses.<br />
