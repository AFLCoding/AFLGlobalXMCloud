        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading fiber optic manufacturer and provider of services, announced today that its LZM-110A+ LAZERMaster was recognized by the annual <a href="https://www.laserfocusworld.com/index.html">Laser Focus World</a> Innovators Awards program. The judges consisted of a panel of senior expert professionals. AFL was honored with a Silver award which recognizes “a very good innovation that resulted in marked improvement over previous methods employed, approaches taken or products/systems used.”<br />
        <br />
        "We are proud of the recognition received by the judges for the continued advancement of our LZM product family and the hard work of our engineering staff that continues to innovate at the highest level in the industry,” said Brad Hendrix, global specialty market manager for AFL. “It’s innovations like this and those of the Fujikura specialty product family that will ensure customers continue to see us as the market leader in fiber optic glass processing.”<br />
        <br />
        The LZM-110A+ LAZERMaster is a splicing, glass processing and fiber ablation machine that uses a CO2 laser heat source to perform splicing, tapering (to create MFAs), lensing, ablation (for cleaving and mode stripping) and other glass-shaping operations with glass diameters up to 2.3 mm. The high-resolution optical analysis system works in conjunction with onboard firmware for fully automatic splicing, tapering and other glass shaping processes.<br />
        <br />
        Alan Bergstein, publisher of <a href="http://www.laserfocusworld.com/">Laser Focus World</a>, said "This prestigious program allows Laser Focus World to celebrate and recognize the most innovative products and services in the photonics and optoelectronics industry. Our 2018 Honorees are an outstanding example of companies who are making an impact." <br />
        <br />
        The Innovators Awards are judged based on innovation, value to the user, sustainability, meeting a defined need, collaboration and impact. The 2018 Laser Focus World Innovators Awards Honorees are featured in the May Issue of Laser Focus World magazine as well as on <a href="http://www.laserfocusworld.com/">www.laserfocusworld.com</a>.<br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading fiber optic manufacturer and provider of services, announced today that its LZM-110A+ LAZERMaster was recognized by the annual <a href="https://www.laserfocusworld.com/index.html">Laser Focus World</a> Innovators Awards program. The judges consisted of a panel of senior expert professionals. AFL was honored with a Silver award which recognizes “a very good innovation that resulted in marked improvement over previous methods employed, approaches taken or products/systems used.”<br />
        <br />
        "We are proud of the recognition received by the judges for the continued advancement of our LZM product family and the hard work of our engineering staff that continues to innovate at the highest level in the industry,” said Brad Hendrix, global specialty market manager for AFL. “It’s innovations like this and those of the Fujikura specialty product family that will ensure customers continue to see us as the market leader in fiber optic glass processing.”<br />
        <br />
        The LZM-110A+ LAZERMaster is a splicing, glass processing and fiber ablation machine that uses a CO2 laser heat source to perform splicing, tapering (to create MFAs), lensing, ablation (for cleaving and mode stripping) and other glass-shaping operations with glass diameters up to 2.3 mm. The high-resolution optical analysis system works in conjunction with onboard firmware for fully automatic splicing, tapering and other glass shaping processes.<br />
