        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> awarded a $5,000 grant to Pendleton Place in support of Smith House, a residential facility that houses up to 10 young women ages 12 to 21. The grant, made possible by <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">AFL’s Community Outreach Program</a>, will help provide care and upkeep for the facility that fosters teens removed from unsafe home environments.</p>
        <div>
        <br />
        “Like all young people, these girls deserve a safe and stable place to call home,” said Jed Dews, executive director for Pendleton Place. “While many of them will exit foster care without a permanent home, we can at least ensure they leave Smith House with the love and independent living skills they need for a successful and healthy life.”<br />
         <br />
        During their stay, residents are provided around-the-clock care, tutors, financial literacy training, employment supports, and more. Pendleton Place coordinates with local school counselors to make sure the residents are reaching their educational requirements and goals, preparing them for success when leaving the foster care system.<br />
         <br />
        Since 1975, Pendleton Place has given a warm and supportive home environment to children in the foster care system. Smith House, since 1986, has specialized in the care of teen girls affected by abuse and neglect.<br />
