        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, introduces the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2DB2708DDA62475082F47147843A3B25&_z=z">LMHD-series MicroCore fiber optic cable</a>. Designed for use in standard HDPE ducts, aerial messenger systems and bundled micro-duct pathways, the LMHD series is a loose tube cable product line with cable diameters up to 50 percent smaller than traditional loose tube cables and a 600 pound load-rating, making it highly versatile for use in most outside plant cable installations.<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/AFL_LMHD.aspx" target="_blank"></a><br />
        <br />
        “The LMHD MicroCore cable series provides significant cost savings for outside plant cable owners,” explained Stephen Martin, product manager for AFL. “Compared to traditional loose tube cables, the significantly smaller size and lighter weight of the LMHD cable can save over 30 percent in shipping, installation and pathway expenses.”<br />
        <br />
        The LMHD-series OSP MicroCore cable, with its 600 pound load-rating, can be pulled into standard HDPE ducts and, because of its small diameter, can be jetted into popular bundled micro-duct pathways. Minimum pathway inside diameters range from 13 mm to 20 mm. When applications require a transition from underground to aerial, the LMHD-series cables can be lashed to aerial messenger wires using standard outside plant cable lashing equipment and techniques.<br />
        <br />
        The LMHD-Series OSP MicroCore fiber optic cables consist of kink-resistant buffer tubes which reduce time and handling issues. Applications include long haul, local loop FTTx, campus backbone connections for 10G, 40G and 100G network transmission speeds. Available in 12 to 432 fibers, the cable designs are Telcordia GR-20 and IEC 60794-5-10 compliant.<br />
