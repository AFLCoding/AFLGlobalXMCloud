        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, recognized several associates for patent awards received for developing new products and technologies within the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DD697FB3AFEA42B2B976EB9288D04701&_z=z">accessories</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&_z=z">optical connectivity</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=55E85DE502FD4DF7A029245253934A91&_z=z">fusion splicing</a> divisions.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s accessories division received four patents. The first is for a “Tandem Trunnion Clamp,” an ADSS cable support device which allows a single cable clamp to be converted to a double cable clamp for use in FTTx applications. The design also allows a field-installed clamp to be easily retrofitted for running a second cable. The next patent is for “Dead End Termination Clamp and Collet.” AFL’s design allows for developing a cable dead end product with variable usage whether with cast body and/or fabricated steel shapes. Additionally, AFL’s solution is universally suited for use on solid wire, large strand and fine stranded cable types. Another patent was received for “Asymmetrical Stockbridge Damper” in which the design allows vibration to be removed from transmission conductors and features a significant weight and cost reduction. Lastly, a patent was issued for “Rigid T-Rail Conductor System,” a t-shaped conductor rail system whereby the product is the only offering that can be utilized with several styles of current collectors such as Pantographs and Trolley Shoes.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s connectivity division received two patents—the first is for “Fiber Optic Splice Closure,” an invention specific to AFL’s Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC)® and Spider Web Ribbons (SWR). The new closure is comprised of a basket organizer that has channels, routings and slack storage areas that eliminate the need for special transition tube or furcation tubing to protect the SWR binder groups as it transitions from the organizer basket to the splice trays. The invention eliminates significant cable and closure preparation time, lowering the overall cost of splicing WTC cable. The second patent is for “Splice-on Optical Connector for Outside Plant Drop Cable.” This invention provides a concept design of AFL’s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Field-Installable-Connectors/Splice-On-Connectors-FuseConnect-Fusion-Splice.aspx">FUSEConnect® connector</a> that enables quick termination on black jacket cable for FTTH (Fiber-to-the-Home) applications.<br />
        <br />
        Lastly, AFL’s fusion splicing division received a patent for “End Cap Holder.” This invention aids in the alignment with an optical fiber prior to splicing. By having an end cap of a different diameter, the power density at the end of the fiber can be adjusted or changed. This is beneficial in applications using high energy lasers.<br />
        <br />

        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, recognized several associates for patent awards received for developing new products and technologies within the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DD697FB3AFEA42B2B976EB9288D04701&_z=z">accessories</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&_z=z">optical connectivity</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=55E85DE502FD4DF7A029245253934A91&_z=z">fusion splicing</a> divisions.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s accessories division received four patents. The first is for a “Tandem Trunnion Clamp,” an ADSS cable support device which allows a single cable clamp to be converted to a double cable clamp for use in FTTx applications. The design also allows a field-installed clamp to be easily retrofitted for running a second cable. The next patent is for “Dead End Termination Clamp and Collet.” AFL’s design allows for developing a cable dead end product with variable usage whether with cast body and/or fabricated steel shapes. Additionally, AFL’s solution is universally suited for use on solid wire, large strand and fine stranded cable types. Another patent was received for “Asymmetrical Stockbridge Damper” in which the design allows vibration to be removed from transmission conductors and features a significant weight and cost reduction. Lastly, a patent was issued for “Rigid T-Rail Conductor System,” a t-shaped conductor rail system whereby the product is the only offering that can be utilized with several styles of current collectors such as Pantographs and Trolley Shoes.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s connectivity division received two patents—the first is for “Fiber Optic Splice Closure,” an invention specific to AFL’s Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC)® and Spider Web Ribbons (SWR). The new closure is comprised of a basket organizer that has channels, routings and slack storage areas that eliminate the need for special transition tube or furcation tubing to protect the SWR binder groups as it transitions from the organizer basket to the splice trays. The invention eliminates significant cable and closure preparation time, lowering the overall cost of splicing WTC cable. The second patent is for “Splice-on Optical Connector for Outside Plant Drop Cable.” This invention provides a concept design of AFL’s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Field-Installable-Connectors/Splice-On-Connectors-FuseConnect-Fusion-Splice.aspx">FUSEConnect® connector</a> that enables quick termination on black jacket cable for FTTH (Fiber-to-the-Home) applications.<br />
        <br />
        Lastly, AFL’s fusion splicing division received a patent for “End Cap Holder.” This invention aids in the alignment with an optical fiber prior to splicing. By having an end cap of a different diameter, the power density at the end of the fiber can be adjusted or changed. This is beneficial in applications using high energy lasers.<br />
