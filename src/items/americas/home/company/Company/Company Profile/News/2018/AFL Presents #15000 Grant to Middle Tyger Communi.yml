        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> awarded a $15,000 grant to the <a href="https://www.middletyger.org/">Middle Tyger Community Center</a> in support of the <a href="https://www.middletyger.org/this-is-my-child">This Is My Child</a> program. The grant, made possible by <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">AFL’s Community Outreach Program</a>, will support the 3K class which is in its second year at the Center. AFL has supported the 3K class previously, with funding focused on equipping the classroom for STEM education.<br />
        <br />
        “Without publicly funded preschool in our area, low income children in our community are particularly at risk for entering school already behind their peers,” explained Andrea Moore, executive director for the Middle Tyger Community Center (MTCC). “AFL’s financial support makes it possible for us to offer a high quality preschool program to children from families who could otherwise not afford to attend preschool.”<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.middletyger.org/this-is-my-child">This Is My Child</a> provides the highest possible quality early care and education for children ages six weeks to 4K. The program maintains a 5-star rating from Quality Counts, mentors childcare programs seeking to improve quality and serves as a model for early childhood education in our community, all while serving a vulnerable population comprised of approximately 70 percent low-income and adolescent families.<br />
        <br />
        This Is My Child is the only preschool program in the Duncan-Lyman-Wellford community focused on school readiness for low-income children. The program expanded to serve more children over the past few years and is currently at maximum enrollment of 50.<br />
        <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more.

        “Without publicly funded preschool in our area, low income children in our community are particularly at risk for entering school already behind their peers,” explained Andrea Moore, executive director for the Middle Tyger Community Center (MTCC). “AFL’s financial support makes it possible for us to offer a high quality preschool program to children from families who could otherwise not afford to attend preschool.”<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.middletyger.org/this-is-my-child">This Is My Child</a> provides the highest possible quality early care and education for children ages six weeks to 4K. The program maintains a 5-star rating from Quality Counts, mentors childcare programs seeking to improve quality and serves as a model for early childhood education in our community, all while serving a vulnerable population comprised of approximately 70 percent low-income and adolescent families.<br />
        <br />
        This Is My Child is the only preschool program in the Duncan-Lyman-Wellford community focused on school readiness for low-income children. The program expanded to serve more children over the past few years and is currently at maximum enrollment of 50.<br />
