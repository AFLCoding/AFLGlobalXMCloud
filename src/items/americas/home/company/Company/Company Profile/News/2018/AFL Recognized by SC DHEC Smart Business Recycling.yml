        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, was one of five South Carolina companies recognized by DHEC’s Smart Business Recycling Program for <a href="http://scdhec.gov/HomeAndEnvironment/BusinessesandCommunities-GoGreen/SmartBusiness/Awards/">Outstanding Waste Reduction & Recycling</a> efforts. AFL is ISO 14001 certified and focuses on  "We are committed to improving our EHS performance year over year,” commented Geoff VanderVeen, director of EHS for AFL’s Spartanburg facilities. “Our associates are trained in recycling and sustainability practices and help us achieve these great results.”</p>
        <div>
        Achievements include reducing electricity consumption use by 35 percent and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 83,441 metric tons of CO2. Natural gas consumption was reduced by 28 percent. These energy reductions are a result of many improvements including, replacing factory lighting; air compressor upgrades and heating and air-conditioning replacement with higher efficiency units.<br />
         <br />
        More than 2,300 tons of fluorescent bulbs, paper, batteries, scrap metal, aluminum, process oil, plastic and electronics were recycled. Pallets and shipping containers are reused and the company distributed reusable bottles and cups to help reduce the amount of waste going to the landfill. Through waste reduction efforts, AFL saw both a decrease in waste disposal costs and earned revenue from the sale of recyclables last year. More than 82 percent of all waste is recycled.  <br />
         <br />
        DHEC’s <a href="http://scdhec.gov/HomeAndEnvironment/BusinessesandCommunities-GoGreen/SmartBusiness/Awards/">Smart Business Recycling Program</a> is designed to help South Carolina’s business reduce the environmental impact of its operations and incorporate environmental stewardship and sustainability in its business practices; promote and recognize businesses for their recycling and sustainability efforts; and provide technical assistance to help facilities begin or expand green practices. The state has a 40 percent recycling rate goal to reach by 2020.<br />

        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, was one of five South Carolina companies recognized by DHEC’s Smart Business Recycling Program for <a href="http://scdhec.gov/HomeAndEnvironment/BusinessesandCommunities-GoGreen/SmartBusiness/Awards/">Outstanding Waste Reduction & Recycling</a> efforts. AFL is ISO 14001 certified and focuses on  "We are committed to improving our EHS performance year over year,” commented Geoff VanderVeen, director of EHS for AFL’s Spartanburg facilities. “Our associates are trained in recycling and sustainability practices and help us achieve these great results.”</p>

        Achievements include reducing electricity consumption use by 35 percent and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 83,441 metric tons of CO2. Natural gas consumption was reduced by 28 percent. These energy reductions are a result of many improvements including, replacing factory lighting; air compressor upgrades and heating and air-conditioning replacement with higher efficiency units.<br />
         <br />
        More than 2,300 tons of fluorescent bulbs, paper, batteries, scrap metal, aluminum, process oil, plastic and electronics were recycled. Pallets and shipping containers are reused and the company distributed reusable bottles and cups to help reduce the amount of waste going to the landfill. Through waste reduction efforts, AFL saw both a decrease in waste disposal costs and earned revenue from the sale of recyclables last year. More than 82 percent of all waste is recycled.  <br />
         <br />
