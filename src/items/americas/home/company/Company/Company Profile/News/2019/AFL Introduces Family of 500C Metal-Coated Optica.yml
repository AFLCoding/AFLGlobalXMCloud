        <div>Spartanburg, SC –  <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank">AFL</a>, an industry-leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment, and accessories, is exhibiting at the <a href="http://2019.otcnet.org/">Offshore Technology Conference (OTC)</a> in Houston, Texas. Visit AFL in booth #4808 to see the newest low-loss, metal-coated VHT Series of optical fibers rated for temperatures up to 500⁰C.<br />
        Historically, commercial, metal-coated fibers exhibited poor optical performance in applications that require high temperature thermal treatment and cycling. In addition to excessive optical loss in high temperature applications, existing metal-coated fibers have only been offered in short, continuous lengths, which has limited use in a variety of long-range sensing systems.<br />
        <br />
        “To overcome all these limitations and to serve the ultra-harsh environment markets, AFL has developed a unique set of optical fibers compatible with standard multimode and single-mode designs that withstand temperatures up to 500⁰C with low optical loss, no adhesion to other metals, and are highly manufacturable in multi-kilometers of continuous lengths,” said Dr. Abdel Soufiane, general manager and CTO of AFL’s Specialty Fiber division.<br />
        <br />
        The new 500⁰C VHT500 single-mode and VHT5000 multimode fibers feature advanced glass chemistries for improved performance in hydrogen-rich environments and excellent optical performance in permanent, long-term exposure to temperatures up to 500⁰C. Maximum attenuation of the VHT Series is 5dB/km for all typical operating wavelengths.<br />
        <br />
        AFL has also developed a patent-pending process that prevents the VHT fiber family from “cold bonding” to metal tubes or other metallically-coated fibers. The new fibers are available in multi-kilometer continuous lengths with industry standard 125 µm cladding diameter. They are also available in a 500⁰C metal cable configuration with three fiber channels for multi-measurement sensing applications.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to the VHT fiber family, AFL will also be launching a carbon silicone mid-temp acrylate (CSMTA) coating combination that is rated to 175⁰C, and available with all AFL waveguide designs. The unique benefits of CSMTA coating will be available at OTC.<br />
        <br />
        Discover all these solutions and more with AFL in booth #4808 at OTC, May 6-9 at NRG Park in Houston, Texas. To learn more about AFL, its products and services, visit <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />

        <div>Spartanburg, SC –  <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank">AFL</a>, an industry-leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment, and accessories, is exhibiting at the <a href="http://2019.otcnet.org/">Offshore Technology Conference (OTC)</a> in Houston, Texas. Visit AFL in booth #4808 to see the newest low-loss, metal-coated VHT Series of optical fibers rated for temperatures up to 500⁰C.<br />
        Historically, commercial, metal-coated fibers exhibited poor optical performance in applications that require high temperature thermal treatment and cycling. In addition to excessive optical loss in high temperature applications, existing metal-coated fibers have only been offered in short, continuous lengths, which has limited use in a variety of long-range sensing systems.<br />
        <br />
        “To overcome all these limitations and to serve the ultra-harsh environment markets, AFL has developed a unique set of optical fibers compatible with standard multimode and single-mode designs that withstand temperatures up to 500⁰C with low optical loss, no adhesion to other metals, and are highly manufacturable in multi-kilometers of continuous lengths,” said Dr. Abdel Soufiane, general manager and CTO of AFL’s Specialty Fiber division.<br />
        <br />
        The new 500⁰C VHT500 single-mode and VHT5000 multimode fibers feature advanced glass chemistries for improved performance in hydrogen-rich environments and excellent optical performance in permanent, long-term exposure to temperatures up to 500⁰C. Maximum attenuation of the VHT Series is 5dB/km for all typical operating wavelengths.<br />
        <br />
        AFL has also developed a patent-pending process that prevents the VHT fiber family from “cold bonding” to metal tubes or other metallically-coated fibers. The new fibers are available in multi-kilometer continuous lengths with industry standard 125 µm cladding diameter. They are also available in a 500⁰C metal cable configuration with three fiber channels for multi-measurement sensing applications.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to the VHT fiber family, AFL will also be launching a carbon silicone mid-temp acrylate (CSMTA) coating combination that is rated to 175⁰C, and available with all AFL waveguide designs. The unique benefits of CSMTA coating will be available at OTC.<br />
        <br />
