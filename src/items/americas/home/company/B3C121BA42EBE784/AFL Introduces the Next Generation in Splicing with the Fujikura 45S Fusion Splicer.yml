        <br />
        <p>Duncan,  S.C. | October 10,  2023 | <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable and  equipment, is expanding its splicing family with the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers-Single-Fiber/Fujikura-45S-Fusion-Splicer">Fujikura 45S Fusion  Splicer</a> in the North American  market. This latest addition brings a transformative approach to fusion  splicing with an industry-first, dual fiber preparation, along with improved  ergonomics and a wide range of new features that meet the growing demands of  the fiber optic industry. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;With  the launch of the 45S, Fujikura continues to lead the way in innovation with  the simultaneous fiber preparation feature&rdquo;, said Lucas Mays, Product Line Manager  for AFL&rsquo;s Fusion Splicing Systems. &ldquo;By enabling operators to build out networks  faster and more efficiently, the 45S addresses the growing demand for  high-speed broadband access.&rdquo; </p>
        <p>Complementing  the innovative design of the 45S, the standard kit includes the SS-05, a  hand-held fiber coating stripper, used to simultaneously strip two 250 &mu;m  coated fibers in one pass. Additionally, the Fujikura CT-50 cleaver adapter  plate enables the cleaving of two bare fibers at the same time. Once the fibers  are prepared for fusion splicing, the 45S patented sheath clamps allow both  fibers to be effortlessly inserted into the splicer with one in each hand. This  feature eliminates the need to load each fiber individually, further  streamlining the splicing process. When paired with a faster tube heater,  splicing cycle time is reduced by 30%.</p>
        <p>The Fujikura 45S  cladding alignment fusion splicer carries forward the proven track record set  by the Fujikura 41S+ Fusion Splicer with features like Active Fusion Control  and Active Blade Management, which enable consistent production of low-loss  splices without user intervention, and Warm Splice Imaging, which provides  improved splice loss estimates, compared with other cladding alignment  splicers, to assess the quality of every splice more accurately.<br />
        Additional features of the Fujikura 45S include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased motor travel to reverse fibers initially loaded too long</li>
            <li>Sheath clamps can open and close with the wind protector</li>
            <li>New and improved removable work tray and transit case</li>
            <li>Easy-access battery, screen position adjustments and ergonomic  adaptations</li>
            <li>Fully ruggedized for shock, moisture and dust resistance</li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <p>Duncan,  S.C. | October 10,  2023 | <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable and  equipment, is expanding its splicing family with the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers-Single-Fiber/Fujikura-45S-Fusion-Splicer">Fujikura 45S Fusion  Splicer</a> in the North American  market. This latest addition brings a transformative approach to fusion  splicing with an industry-first, dual fiber preparation, along with improved  ergonomics and a wide range of new features that meet the growing demands of  the fiber optic industry. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;With  the launch of the 45S, Fujikura continues to lead the way in innovation with  the simultaneous fiber preparation feature&rdquo;, said Lucas Mays, Product Line Manager  for AFL&rsquo;s Fusion Splicing Systems. &ldquo;By enabling operators to build out networks  faster and more efficiently, the 45S addresses the growing demand for  high-speed broadband access.&rdquo; </p>
        <p>Complementing  the innovative design of the 45S, the standard kit includes the SS-05, a  hand-held fiber coating stripper, used to simultaneously strip two 250 &mu;m  coated fibers in one pass. Additionally, the Fujikura CT-50 cleaver adapter  plate enables the cleaving of two bare fibers at the same time. Once the fibers  are prepared for fusion splicing, the 45S patented sheath clamps allow both  fibers to be effortlessly inserted into the splicer with one in each hand. This  feature eliminates the need to load each fiber individually, further  streamlining the splicing process. When paired with a faster tube heater,  splicing cycle time is reduced by 30%.</p>
        <p>The Fujikura 45S  cladding alignment fusion splicer carries forward the proven track record set  by the Fujikura 41S+ Fusion Splicer with features like Active Fusion Control  and Active Blade Management, which enable consistent production of low-loss  splices without user intervention, and Warm Splice Imaging, which provides  improved splice loss estimates, compared with other cladding alignment  splicers, to assess the quality of every splice more accurately.<br />
        Additional features of the Fujikura 45S include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased motor travel to reverse fibers initially loaded too long</li>
            <li>Sheath clamps can open and close with the wind protector</li>
            <li>New and improved removable work tray and transit case</li>
            <li>Easy-access battery, screen position adjustments and ergonomic  adaptations</li>
            <li>Fully ruggedized for shock, moisture and dust resistance</li>
        </ul>
