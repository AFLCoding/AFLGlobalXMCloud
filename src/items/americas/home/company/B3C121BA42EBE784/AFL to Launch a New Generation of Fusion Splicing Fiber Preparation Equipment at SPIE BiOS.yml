        <p><span style="color: black;">Designed with capability and performance in mind, AFL&rsquo;s new recoaters and cleavers will enhance fiber preparation and protection for fusion splicing as well as service the complex needs of those utilizing specialty optical fibers. These high-performance tools help improve reliability and reproducibility, resulting in a higher degree of confidence for those who utilize these products.</span></p>
        <p><span>AFL&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/LAZERMaster-LZM125A-Splicing-System"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">LZM-125A+ LAZERMaster Splicing System</span></a><span style="color: #00b0f0;"> </span><span>is a glass processor and fiber ablation machine that uses a CO2 laser heat source to perform splicing, tapering, lensing ablation and other glass shaping operations with glass diameters from 80 &micro;m up to 2.0 mm. The high-resolution optical analysis system works in conjunction with on-board firmware for fully automatic glass shaping processes. The LZM-125 splicing system also includes a self-contained workstation.</span></p>
        <p><span>Both shows will host demonstrations of the Fujikura 90R Ribbon Splicer with replaceable V-grooves and the Fujikura 90S+ Core Alignment Splicer with Active Fusion Control (AFC) technology. The Fujikura 90R is the splicing solution to manage increased traffic, higher fiber counts and greater data demand. With automated splice start, tube heater, wind protector, cleave tracking and blade rotations for up to two cleavers at a time, this splicer frees up operator time for other fiber preparation steps. Additionally, user-replaceable V-grooves allow technicians to keep the splicer in the field for a longer period of time. When V-grooves can no longer be cleaned after extended use, or are accidentally damaged, technicians can resume splicing in minutes by installing the spare set included with a 90R.</span></p>
        <p><span>AFL will also feature the Fujikura FSM-100P/P+ specialty fiber fusion splicer, which includes a new observation method for fiber rotational alignment referred to as the IPA2. This method provides an enhanced alignment technique for shaped and multi-core fibers and keeps the previously existing FSM100P/P+ alignment capabilities.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p><span>Made with superior heat and chemical resistance to conventional UV curable coating material, AFL&rsquo;s PCS-100 Polyimide Fiber Coating Stripper uses a mechanical stripping method which provides a safe, consistent and quick stripping solution. The blade of this flexible tool is applied to the fiber with specific tension and the coating is precisely planed along the fiber automatically, resulting in an efficient and swift process. Operating this tool is also safer than other methods since this stripper does not use hot acid. Additionally, the fiber quality degradation is kept at a minimum as the glass surface is not damaged by oxidization of the coating during burning or arcing.</span></p>
        <p> <span style="line-height: 107%;">The SFF Microbundle has a diameter of 400 &micro;m and contains three distinct stranded bend-insensitive 80 &micro;m single-mode fibers (SMF). The microbundle can easily be stripped to reveal the three fibers inside, allowing the user to triple the amount of data that could be transmitted compared to a single SMF without requiring three times the space. For sensing applications, the three fibers can be used to monitor temperature, strain, and acoustics. The SFF microbundle is like a multi-core fiber, but without splice loss or crosstalk problems. Splicing the 80 &micro;m fibers to other fibers is also simple with the Fujikura 90S+ fusion splicer.</span></p>

        <p><span style="color: black;">Spartanburg, S.C. |&nbsp;<em>January 24, 2023</em> | </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">AFL</span></a><span style="color: windowtext;">, an </span><span style="color: black;">industry-leading manufacturer in fiber optic cable, fusion splicers and accessories, will debut a new lineup of specialty fiber preparation equipment at </span><a href="https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/photonics-west/exhibitions/bios-expo"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">SPIE BiOS</span></a><span style="color: black;"> and </span><a href="https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/photonics-west/photonics-west-exhibition"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Photonics West</span></a><span style="color: black;">, January 28-February 2, at The Moscone Center in San Francisco. Visit booth #8029 (BiOS) and #3029 (Photonics West) to see these newly-released recoaters and cleavers along with other products including </span><span>LAZERMaster&reg; glass shaping and splicing system, </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers-Ribbon-Fiber/Fujikura-90R-Fusion-Splicer?gclid=CjwKCAjwyaWZBhBGEiwACslQo1-8zX3rDnRxMKqLecKsR8zSxg7gaTy5Jnj6TXYDB-J_jPMbhTYzehoCYa0QAvD_BwE"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Fujikura 90R</span></a><span style="color: black;"> and </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Field-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers-Single-Fiber/Fujikura-90S-Fusion-Splicer.aspx"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">90S+ Fusion Splicers</span></a><span style="color: windowtext;">,</span><span style="color: #00b0f0;"> </span><a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/product-fusion-splicing-specialty/specialty-fiber-fusion-splicer-fsm-100p"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">Fujikura FSM-100P/P+ specialty fiber fusion splicer</span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> and</span><span style="color: #00b0f0;"> </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Stripping-Cleaning-and-Fiber-Prep-Automation/PCS-100-Polyimide-Coating-Stripper"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">PCS-100 Polyimide Coating Stripper</span></a><span style="color: windowtext;">.</span><span style="color: #00b0f0;"> </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Products/Specialty-Optical-Fiber"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">AFL&rsquo;s Specialty Optical Fiber</span></a><span style="color: #00b0f0;"></span><span>division will also feature its &ldquo;Small Form Factor Microbundle&rdquo; (SFF) at Photonics West.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Designed with capability and performance in mind, AFL&rsquo;s new recoaters and cleavers will enhance fiber preparation and protection for fusion splicing as well as service the complex needs of those utilizing specialty optical fibers. These high-performance tools help improve reliability and reproducibility, resulting in a higher degree of confidence for those who utilize these products.</span></p>
        <p><span>AFL&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/LAZERMaster-LZM125A-Splicing-System"><span style="color: #00b0f0;">LZM-125A+ LAZERMaster Splicing System</span></a><span style="color: #00b0f0;"> </span><span>is a glass processor and fiber ablation machine that uses a CO2 laser heat source to perform splicing, tapering, lensing ablation and other glass shaping operations with glass diameters from 80 &micro;m up to 2.0 mm. The high-resolution optical analysis system works in conjunction with on-board firmware for fully automatic glass shaping processes. The LZM-125 splicing system also includes a self-contained workstation.</span></p>
        <p><span>Both shows will host demonstrations of the Fujikura 90R Ribbon Splicer with replaceable V-grooves and the Fujikura 90S+ Core Alignment Splicer with Active Fusion Control (AFC) technology. The Fujikura 90R is the splicing solution to manage increased traffic, higher fiber counts and greater data demand. With automated splice start, tube heater, wind protector, cleave tracking and blade rotations for up to two cleavers at a time, this splicer frees up operator time for other fiber preparation steps. Additionally, user-replaceable V-grooves allow technicians to keep the splicer in the field for a longer period of time. When V-grooves can no longer be cleaned after extended use, or are accidentally damaged, technicians can resume splicing in minutes by installing the spare set included with a 90R.</span></p>
        <p><span>AFL will also feature the Fujikura FSM-100P/P+ specialty fiber fusion splicer, which includes a new observation method for fiber rotational alignment referred to as the IPA2. This method provides an enhanced alignment technique for shaped and multi-core fibers and keeps the previously existing FSM100P/P+ alignment capabilities.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p><span>Made with superior heat and chemical resistance to conventional UV curable coating material, AFL&rsquo;s PCS-100 Polyimide Fiber Coating Stripper uses a mechanical stripping method which provides a safe, consistent and quick stripping solution. The blade of this flexible tool is applied to the fiber with specific tension and the coating is precisely planed along the fiber automatically, resulting in an efficient and swift process. Operating this tool is also safer than other methods since this stripper does not use hot acid. Additionally, the fiber quality degradation is kept at a minimum as the glass surface is not damaged by oxidization of the coating during burning or arcing.</span></p>
        <p> <span style="line-height: 107%;">The SFF Microbundle has a diameter of 400 &micro;m and contains three distinct stranded bend-insensitive 80 &micro;m single-mode fibers (SMF). The microbundle can easily be stripped to reveal the three fibers inside, allowing the user to triple the amount of data that could be transmitted compared to a single SMF without requiring three times the space. For sensing applications, the three fibers can be used to monitor temperature, strain, and acoustics. The SFF microbundle is like a multi-core fiber, but without splice loss or crosstalk problems. Splicing the 80 &micro;m fibers to other fibers is also simple with the Fujikura 90S+ fusion splicer.</span></p>
