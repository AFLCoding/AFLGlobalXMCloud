        <p>Duncan, S.C. | July 26, 2023 | <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com">AFL</a> celebrated its annual employee giving campaign, <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Company/Community#giving">Imagine That</a>, by presenting a $607,000 donation to the <a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a>. AFL remains committed to supporting  communities locally and worldwide in areas where the company has operations. This  donation was made possible by the generosity of AFL associates and AFL's  matching program. </p>
        <p>Paige Stephenson, President  and CEO of United Way of the Piedmont, expressed her appreciation for AFL's  exceptional corporate partnership, stating, "AFL is an amazing community partner!  The company truly lives out its core values through its community outreach, and  we consider AFL to be an example of true corporate and community partners.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>During the two-week campaign,  AFL associates worldwide were asked to &ldquo;Imagine a better community&rdquo; and commit  to making a positive and lasting impact on the lives of others. Contributions  were matched dollar-for-dollar up to $100 for all donors, and an unlimited  match for donors new to the campaign. AFL locations around the world conducted  campaigns during the month of May and generated $750,000 for AFL communities  globally. </p>
        <p>AFL has previously received  the Large Business Partner of the Year award from United Way of the Piedmont  and was nominated for the second consecutive year. This recognition is awarded  to a company with 100 or more employees, considering various factors such as  overall campaign giving, average gift amount, per capita contribution,  undesignated giving, participation rate and intangible qualities like committed  top-down leadership, exceptional campaign management, a philanthropic corporate  culture and board/donor group involvement.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a>&rsquo;s mission is to connect, engage and inspire people to transform  the community. By 2030, its goal is to decrease the number of individuals  living below self-sufficiency by 11,000. As part of their work in education,  financial stability and health, United Way of the Piedmont is committed to  ensuring that the programs invested in, and the outcomes generated are  equitable.</p>
        <p>AFL  has an extensive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community  Outreach Program&nbsp;</a>that  provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief  and more.
