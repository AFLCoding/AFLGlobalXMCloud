        <p>Duncan,  S.C. | October 9, 2023 | Members of AFL&rsquo;s executive leadership team recently met  with the Senior Advisor to the President and Director of the Office of Public  Engagement, Stephen Benjamin, in Washington, D.C. The purpose of the meeting  was to discuss the Biden-Harris Administration&rsquo;s Build America, Buy America Act  (BABA) policies and funding related to the expansion of broadband access and  modernizing the power grid across America.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;AFL is supportive of the Biden  administration&rsquo;s infrastructure initiatives, especially as they relate to  universal broadband access and grid modernization,&rdquo; expressed Jaxon Lang, AFL  President and CEO. &ldquo;We believe that we are well positioned to make significant  contributions to these initiatives and are prepared to make the necessary  investments.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>According to the White House, the  requirements for BABA are essential to maximize the economic potential of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/03/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-high-speed-internet-investments-spur-made-in-america-manufacturing-boom/">Internet  for All</a> initiative. By manufacturing the necessary construction  materials domestically, manufacturers have the opportunity to create jobs and  deliver affordable, reliable high-speed internet service to millions of  Americans. The Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program will use  funds to purchase items made in the U.S., to support the deployment of the  broadband infrastructure necessary for universal coverage.</p>
