        <p>North  Grafton, MA and Spartanburg, S.C. | April 25, 2023 | As part of its ongoing  commitment to produce industry-leading solutions, <a href="file:///C:/Users/phyllis/Downloads/aflglobal.com">AFL</a>, a  manufacturer of optical fibers, fiber optic cable, connectivity, accessories  and equipment introduces the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Specialty-Optical-Fiber/Harsh-Environments-Products/VHS400-Series-Harsh-Environment-Fibers">VHS400 Series</a>. AFL&rsquo;s Verrillon&reg; line of specialty optical fibers are designed to  withstand ultra-harsh environments within the Oil &amp; Gas, Industrial, Geothermal  and Military markets.</p>
        <p>VHS400 Series is a pure silica core  dual-wavelength single mode optical fiber that is optimized for use at both  1310 nm and 1550 nm wavelengths. With its entirely down-doped cladding design,  VHS400 Series fibers are engineered to have nine times bend loss improvement  over commercial pure silica core fiber designs. Additionally, the VHS400 Series  pure silica core chemistry will deliver the ultimate performance against  hydrogen darkening.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Our VHS500 is a pure silica core single mode  fiber designed for 1550 nm operation and has been deployed in hundreds of harsh  environment applications since 2012. The new VHS400 will allow our customers to  use this same fiber design for applications that require single-mode operation  at 1310 nm and 1550 nm&rdquo;, explained Dr. Abdel Soufiane, general manager and CTO  for AFL&rsquo;s Specialty Fiber Division. &ldquo;The VHS400 has unmatched performance when  exposed to harsh environments with exceptionally low bend loss.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The VHS400 fiber family is manufactured with  various coatings &ndash; including carbon, silicone/PFA, mid-temp acrylate and  polyimide&ndash; allowing it to withstand high temperatures and hydrogen-containing  atmospheres. Carbon coating can provide hermeticity against water and hydrogen  in downhole applications and improves fatigue resistance in long-term  deployments.</p>
        <p>The VHS400 fiber series is available at proof  test levels of 100 kpsi and 200 kpsi.</p>
