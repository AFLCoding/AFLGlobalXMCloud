        <p>Spartanburg, S.C. | June  26, 2023 | This week, <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com">AFL</a> released a new software update for<strong> </strong><a name="_Hlk92726114"></a><a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Test-Management-and-Reporting-Software/FlexReporter-Software-Suite">FlexReporter&trade; </a>, a  cloud-based, high-performance  reporting platform. FlexReporter  software addresses the reporting needs of leading telecom providers,  enterprise customers and Hyperscale datacenters. The latest update brings enhanced features that will  revolutionize report generation. </p>
        <p>Flex Reporters' ultra-fast cloud report engine now includes a  bi-directional OTDR reporting feature in its version 1.3 update. Project  Managers can now easily access bi-directional results via the ultra-fast  engine, inclusive of link summaries, trace results and event tables. The trace  results graph presents a merged representation of data from both directions  seamlessly overlaid on a single graph. </p>
        <p>The latest update adds a new and improved feature to FlexReports&trade;  - an Excel reporting function that is both easy to navigate and perfect for  detailing large cable applications. Multiple cables can be saved to a single  workbook. Embedded hyperlinks make navigation quick and easy between fiber  setups, link results and event data. Additionally, built-in data filters and  outlining make it easy to customize reports and highlight only the data you  need.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Test-Management-and-Reporting-Software/FlexReporter-Software-Suite">FlexReporter</a> will continue supporting reports for all AFL FlexScan OTDRs,  FOCIS inspection systems, OLTS, and OPM products. It also provides a seamless  migration for thousands of users of our legacy reporting systems. <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Products/Test-and-Inspection">Click here</a> to  view AFL&rsquo;s complete product line of&nbsp;test  and inspection devices&nbsp;plus accessories. </p>
