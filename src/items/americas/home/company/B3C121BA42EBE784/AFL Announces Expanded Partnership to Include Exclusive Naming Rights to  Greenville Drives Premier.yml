        <p>Spartanburg, S.C. |&nbsp;April 6,  2023&nbsp;| <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com">AFL</a> is  pleased to announce its expanded multi-year partnership with <a href="https://www.milb.com/greenville">The Greenville Drive</a>, a South Atlantic League Affiliate of the Boston Red  Sox. This opportunity positions AFL as the presenting sponsor of The Champions  Club, the highest end hospitality area at Fluor Field. &nbsp;AFL, an industry leading  manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment, accessories and related services,  remains committed to community outreach through this partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The  partnership was inspired by a shared sense of connection by both organizations.  As AFL connects people and solutions throughout the industry, the Greenville  Drive connects its players and fans to baseball in the regional community. </p>
        <p>As part of its  partnership, AFL will receive naming rights associated with the Champions Club,  significant brand awareness inside the space as well as a visible presence  throughout the stadium. This newly renovated hospitality area will creatively  showcase the AFL brand, product portfolio and community impact story. In  addition, the Drive will collaborate with AFL to deliver customized experiences  for Club guests in a variety of markets to further amplify the shared  connection. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;AFL is honored  to expand our partnership with the Greenville Drive by securing naming rights  of the Champions Club&rdquo;, said Jody Gallagher, President and CEO of AFL. &ldquo;This  partnership is larger than branding the space &ndash; it&rsquo;s about deepening our roots  in the community and creating valuable, lasting connections.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The Champion&rsquo;s  Club is an exclusive year-round event space, offering an elevated experience  for group outings, networking and corporate events. The space accommodates up  to 300 guests, and features a chef-driven menu, buffet options and several unique  event/reception opportunities. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Our  partnership with AFL is unique and strategic, and we&rsquo;re thrilled to expand our  relationship with the addition of the AFL Champions Club,&rdquo; said Greenville  Drive President, Jeff Brown. &ldquo;Through its world class products and services,  AFL helps connect our community and the world, and the AFL Champions Club will  help further tell AFL&rsquo;s story of connection all year long at Fluor Field.&rdquo;  &nbsp;</p>
        <p>A ribbon  cutting for the now-branded AFL Champions Club was held April 5, ahead of the  2023&nbsp;season that begins with a home opener on Tuesday, April 11. </p>
