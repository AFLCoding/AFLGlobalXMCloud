        <p>Duncan,  S.C. &ndash; September 21,  2023 | Industry-leading manufacturer of  fiber optic cable, connectivity, accessories and equipment, <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com">AFL</a>, expands its CopperClad Steel (CCS) Wire  Line with the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/en/Products/Conductor-Accessories/CopperClad/OnyxCCS-Copperclad-Steel-Wire">OnyxCCS&reg; Solution</a>. This latest  innovation to AFL&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories.aspx">Conductor Accessories</a> line is  specifically designed for  the electric utility market as it offers seamless integration into existing  infrastructure. </p>
        <p>
        "OnyxCCS is an innovative solution  for the energy market," expressed Mike Tolman, AFL Accessories Product  Line Manager. "We believe this solution will strengthen the power  infrastructure by providing increased performance, cost savings and reliability  in an enhanced theft-resistant package."
        </p>
        <p>OnyxCCS builds upon the enhancements of AFL&rsquo;s standard  CopperClad Steel, while continuing to offer the same benefits. In addition to  the inherent strength of a CCS product, OnyxCCS has a chemically-etched surface  treatment, which darkens the standard CCS. This process discourages theft of a utility&rsquo;s  copper infrastructure and does not compromise mechanical or electrical properties. </p>
        <p>Engineered to withstand the harshest environmental  conditions, OnyxCCS ensures uninterrupted performance and reliability. With its  exceptional resistance to corrosion and extended lifespan, OnyxCCS provides  long-term operational dependability while promoting sustainable practices. Additionally,  its steel core provides increased strength, compared to standard copper in  tensioned applications, and potentially reduces outages caused by copper theft.</p>
        <p>OnyxCCS is available in all sizes of AFL&rsquo;s Copperclad  Steel Wire product line.</p>
        <p>AFL&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories.aspx">conductor  accessories</a> provide superior performance  and reliability for electric power utilities companies. Products include  substation accessories, fiber optic cable hardware, motion control, wire  products, tools, compounds and more.
