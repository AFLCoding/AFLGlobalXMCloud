        <h1>Edge Computing Solutions</h1>
        <h2>Edge Solutions</h2>
        <p>In today’s hyperconnected world, companies need a way to scale and analyze data faster, cheaper, and better. The only way to do that is to move out of the cloud and on to the edge of the network, where most of the future data will be generated.</p>
        <p>Edge computing “extends” the cloud network by bringing it closer to the applications and delivering services such as compute storage and processing power. This relieves the load on the cloud data center processing units and reduces traffic between applications and the cloud. As a result, it reduces latency, increases network efficiency, and saves companies money in backhaul costs.</p>
        <p>The edge is a continuum and spans anywhere between the end-device and the cloud/internet.</p>
        <h2>Metro Edge (PoP) and Colocation Data Centers</h2>
        <p>Network traffic is continuing to grow, and a significant share of traffic will be terminated in regional and metro edge compute nodes. Cloud service providers, such as large hyperscalers, use existing Points of Presence (POP) or other telecom installations to deploy edge data center facilities when they are placed at a strategic location.</p>
        <p>Edge Computing is making regional and colocation data centers more attractive. Their location in first- and second-tier markets make them convenient to deliver infrastructure to Enterprises in smaller increments. Colocation data centers host hundreds of different types of customers so will usually be either in or near a major city, serving a significant population.</p>
        <p>These data centers demand flexible, scalable, high-performance fiber infrastructure, designed to support increasingly demanding applications and customer requirements. AFL has the expertise to make sure your network is giving you the competitive edge - from outside plant cable to the customer cage.</p>
        <h2>Central Office</h2>
        <p>Privately owned by telecom service providers, ‘central offices’ are found in every locality, and are regarded as being at the outer edge of the mobile network. While they formerly served fixed line connections, they are being repurposed into more digital facilities, making them good candidates for edge cloud data centers. Located between the RAN and the core, central offices are close to the end-user and data centers here can achieve latency of ~30 ms.</p>
        <h2>Facility, Factory, Campus and Venue</h2>
        <p>The edge network will need to extend to office campuses, factories, warehouses, hospitals and logistic centers to support data collection from IoT devices and sensors. </p>
        <p>Here we are referring to micro-data centers at the customer site. These can take many shapes or forms. We are seeing edge being deployed as one or two servers, as a rack co-located in the existing on-premises data center, or as a mini-data center enclosure which could be up to a single rack. These special- purpose edge data centers are small enough to fit in atypical data center locations, such as on the rooftops of commercial buildings, in parking lots, in business parks, on university campuses, or near high-traffic locations in major population clusters like sports stadiums. </p>
        <h2>Macro Site, Small Cell, CRAN, FWA and Private LTE Cell Nodes</h2>
        <p>Many edge computing models see cellular base stations as key points to connect end-user devices to the core network. Some edge strategies include the deployment of data storage and compute capacity at tower sites, which will require enclosures that reside at the base of the tower. </p>
        <p>Edge compute co-located with small cells, Centralized Radio Access Network (CRAN), Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and Private LTE Cell nodes provide commercial and operational advantages in key industry segments, such as automation and Industry 4.0, worksites, mission critical services, enterprises and public safety. These challenging environments drive the need for dense, high-performance compute outside of the data center and create a need for diversity in infrastructure. Such environments require designs that have the capability to meet strict space constraints as well as to operate in dusty, less- well maintained, less temperature-regulated conditions.</p>
        <h2>Street-side OSP Cabinets/Fixtures</h2>
        <p>Street-side cabinets represent the smallest data center form factor at the edge. These cabinets are designed to hold anywhere from a quarter-rack to two full racks of modern data center equipment in highly remote locations. Infrastructure must meet strict space constraints as well as to operate in dusty, less- well maintained, less temperature regulated conditions. These are designed to be as close to the end-user as possible, where latency is lowest and 2-5ms roundtrip is achievable.</p>
        <h2>Test and Inspection</h2>
        <p>Test and Inspection are a key component of delivering reliability at the edge and any edge deployment strategy. AFL’s comprehensive portfolio of Test and Inspection solutions provide network optimization and assurance across the entire spectrum of diverse edge compute environments. Solutions such as optic inspection, cleaning, and identification to optical loss testing and OTDRs, provide you with the confidence to deploy network infrastructure at the edge efficiently.</p>
        <h2>Edge computing has the potential to unleash a variety of advanced use cases resulting in new user experiences and new business opportunities. However, the Edge is not in one place, it is a continuum. Edge applications and environments are complex and demand solutions that address a range of unique characteristics. With our broad portfolio of fiber infrastructure solutions, AFL can help you configure the perfect solution for your specific edge environment.</h2>

        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;">AFL offers industry-leading solutions for LTE and 5G fronthaul and backhaul. As wireless data traffic continues to grow exponentially, the demands placed on the access network also continue to grow in two important ways. First, through the addition of more small cell sites covering smaller areas, and secondly through the increase in data traffic to and from each cell site. A further development is in the implementation of CRAN (Centralized or Cloud Radio Access Network) which centralizes base station functions for several small sell sites.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Key challenges faced by operators include planning the connections to many small cell sites, making (and getting permits for) pathways and hand-holes to connect all of these sites, and planning future flexibility in case more small cells need to be added later&mdash;or another wireless operator comes along, representing a potential customer and revenue stream for the access network. Here again, the key characteristics of the AFL Converged Access Network provide critical advantages.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;"><strong>Expandability</strong>. AFL&rsquo;s Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC) with SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg; (SWR&reg;) provides the highest amount of ribbon fibers in the smallest space possible. This allows more fiber to be deployed in the same duct space and coiled in smaller handholes, easing installation and permitting, and allowing for future growth. AFL also offers highly modular connectivity solutions which can be expanded and modified to accommodate new customers.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;"><strong>Flexibility</strong>. AFL&rsquo;s solutions allow the Access Network to be redesigned to accommodate new customers and usage cases. The design of SWR allows for simple separation of one to 12 fibers at a time. The use of highly modular components in our ASCEND panels and other products allows for changes to the number of fibers connected, the use and type of Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) employed, and more.&nbsp; This allows the access network operator to build a network today with the confidence that they can adjust it as future demand patterns change.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;"><strong>Accessibility</strong>. It is one thing to design a network that is expandable and flexible, but to make use of those characteristics, someone needs to go out in the field and make a change. AFL creates craft-friendly solutions so that the change process simple.</p>
        <ul style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; list-style-image: url('https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/bulletRound.aspx');">
            <li>SWR technology makes it easy to identify and separate any number of fibers from an existing cable to make a new connection.</li>
            <li>Wrapping Tube Cable is flexible enough to store easily in a handhole or aerial slack loop.</li>
            <li>Closures are easy to enter, change, exit and re-seal.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Fujikura core alignment fusion splicers, like the 90S and 90R, make splicing easy to perform and document. AFL leads the industry in solutions for splicing dissimilar fibers like 200 &micro;m to 250 &micro;m and bend insensitive to standard fiber.</li>
            <li>Test and inspection equipment is easy to learn and use, making documentation a cinch.</li>

        <p>AFL offers industry-leading solutions for LTE and 5G fronthaul and backhaul. As wireless data traffic continues to grow exponentially, the demands placed on the access network also continue to grow in two important ways. First, through the addition of more small cell sites covering smaller areas, and secondly through the increase in data traffic to and from each cell site. A further development is in the implementation of CRAN (Centralized or Cloud Radio Access Network) which centralizes base station functions for several small sell sites.</p>
        <p>
        Key challenges faced by operators include planning the connections to many small cell sites, making (and getting permits for) pathways and hand-holes to connect all of these sites, and planning future flexibility in case more small cells need to be added later&mdash;or another wireless operator comes along, representing a potential customer and revenue stream for the access network. Here again, the key characteristics of the AFL Converged Access Network provide critical advantages.</p>

        <h1>Edge Computing Solutions</h1>
        <h2>Edge Solutions</h2>
        <p>In today’s hyperconnected world, companies need a way to scale and analyze data faster, cheaper, and better. The only way to do that is to move out of the cloud and on to the edge of the network, where most of the future data will be generated.</p>
        <p>Edge computing “extends” the cloud network by bringing it closer to the applications and delivering services such as compute storage and processing power. This relieves the load on the cloud data center processing units and reduces traffic between applications and the cloud. As a result, it reduces latency, increases network efficiency, and saves companies money in backhaul costs.</p>
        <p>The edge is a continuum and spans anywhere between the end-device and the cloud/internet.</p>
        <h2>Metro Edge (PoP) and Colocation Data Centers</h2>
        <p>Network traffic is continuing to grow, and a significant share of traffic will be terminated in regional and metro edge compute nodes. Cloud service providers, such as large hyperscalers, use existing Points of Presence (POP) or other telecom installations to deploy edge data center facilities when they are placed at a strategic location.</p>
        <p>Edge Computing is making regional and colocation data centers more attractive. Their location in first- and second-tier markets make them convenient to deliver infrastructure to Enterprises in smaller increments. Colocation data centers host hundreds of different types of customers so will usually be either in or near a major city, serving a significant population.</p>
        <p>These data centers demand flexible, scalable, high-performance fiber infrastructure, designed to support increasingly demanding applications and customer requirements. AFL has the expertise to make sure your network is giving you the competitive edge - from outside plant cable to the customer cage.</p>
        <h2>Central Office</h2>
        <p>Privately owned by telecom service providers, ‘central offices’ are found in every locality, and are regarded as being at the outer edge of the mobile network. While they formerly served fixed line connections, they are being repurposed into more digital facilities, making them good candidates for edge cloud data centers. Located between the RAN and the core, central offices are close to the end-user and data centers here can achieve latency of ~30 ms.</p>
        <h2>Facility, Factory, Campus and Venue</h2>
        <p>The edge network will need to extend to office campuses, factories, warehouses, hospitals and logistic centers to support data collection from IoT devices and sensors. </p>
        <p>Here we are referring to micro-data centers at the customer site. These can take many shapes or forms. We are seeing edge being deployed as one or two servers, as a rack co-located in the existing on-premises data center, or as a mini-data center enclosure which could be up to a single rack. These special- purpose edge data centers are small enough to fit in atypical data center locations, such as on the rooftops of commercial buildings, in parking lots, in business parks, on university campuses, or near high-traffic locations in major population clusters like sports stadiums. </p>
        <h2>Macro Site, Small Cell, CRAN, FWA and Private LTE Cell Nodes</h2>
        <p>Many edge computing models see cellular base stations as key points to connect end-user devices to the core network. Some edge strategies include the deployment of data storage and compute capacity at tower sites, which will require enclosures that reside at the base of the tower. </p>
        <p>Edge compute co-located with small cells, Centralized Radio Access Network (CRAN), Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and Private LTE Cell nodes provide commercial and operational advantages in key industry segments, such as automation and Industry 4.0, worksites, mission critical services, enterprises and public safety. These challenging environments drive the need for dense, high-performance compute outside of the data center and create a need for diversity in infrastructure. Such environments require designs that have the capability to meet strict space constraints as well as to operate in dusty, less- well maintained, less temperature-regulated conditions.</p>
        <h2>Street-side OSP Cabinets/Fixtures</h2>
        <p>Street-side cabinets represent the smallest data center form factor at the edge. These cabinets are designed to hold anywhere from a quarter-rack to two full racks of modern data center equipment in highly remote locations. Infrastructure must meet strict space constraints as well as to operate in dusty, less- well maintained, less temperature regulated conditions. These are designed to be as close to the end-user as possible, where latency is lowest and 2-5ms roundtrip is achievable.</p>
        <h2>Test and Inspection</h2>
        <p>Test and Inspection are a key component of delivering reliability at the edge and any edge deployment strategy. AFL’s comprehensive portfolio of Test and Inspection solutions provide network optimization and assurance across the entire spectrum of diverse edge compute environments. Solutions such as optic inspection, cleaning, and identification to optical loss testing and OTDRs, provide you with the confidence to deploy network infrastructure at the edge efficiently.</p>
        <h2>Edge computing has the potential to unleash a variety of advanced use cases resulting in new user experiences and new business opportunities. However, the Edge is not in one place, it is a continuum. Edge applications and environments are complex and demand solutions that address a range of unique characteristics. With our broad portfolio of fiber infrastructure solutions, AFL can help you configure the perfect solution for your specific edge environment.</h2>
