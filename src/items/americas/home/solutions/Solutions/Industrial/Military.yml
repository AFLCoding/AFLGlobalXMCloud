        The military industry, including the aerospace and defense industries rely on AFL for high reliability fiber optic products and versatile equipment for photonics manufacturing</h2>
        <p>
        <br />
        Fiber optic technology is increasingly used in avionics, communications and in-flight entertainment systems associated with air and space platforms because of its bandwidth, light weight and resistance to electromagnetic interference. Gyroscopes, strain sensors and other fiber optic sensing systems are being deployed on these platforms for similar reasons. AFL provides aerospace and defense OEMs with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Specialty fiber products
            <ul>
                <li>
                Polyimide, fluoropolymer and carbon coated fibers which are highly resistant to radiation and extreme temperatures and offer superior resistance to fatigue failure</li>
                <li>
                Polarization maintaining (PM) fibers</li>
                <li>
                Specialty fiber assemblies</li>

        The military industry, including the aerospace and defense industries rely on AFL for high reliability fiber optic products and versatile equipment for photonics manufacturing</h2>
        <p>
        <br />
        Fiber optic technology is increasingly used in avionics, communications and in-flight entertainment systems associated with air and space platforms because of its bandwidth, light weight and resistance to electromagnetic interference. Gyroscopes, strain sensors and other fiber optic sensing systems are being deployed on these platforms for similar reasons. AFL provides aerospace and defense OEMs with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Specialty fiber products
            <ul>
                <li>
                Polyimide, fluoropolymer and carbon coated fibers which are highly resistant to radiation and extreme temperatures and offer superior resistance to fatigue failure</li>
                <li>
                Polarization maintaining (PM) fibers</li>
                <li>
