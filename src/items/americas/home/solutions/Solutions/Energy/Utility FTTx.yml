        <p>Electric utilities have relied on AFL for over 30 years. From <a href="/Solutions/Energy/Transmission-and-Distribution">transmission</a> and <a href="/Solutions/Energy/Substation">substation</a> accessories to <a href="/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable">cable</a> and <a href="/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Fiber-Optic-Cable-Hardware">fiber optic hardware</a>, AFL’s solutions improve the reliability of critical electrical and optical infrastructure used for the transmission and distribution of electricity. That same infrastructure also supports <a href="/FTTX">FTTx networks</a> for delivering new services to electric utility customers.</p>
        <p>Increasing demand for high-speed applications is driving many utilities to invest in or expand upon fiber optic networks. In the 1930s, large electric companies claimed it was too expensive and would result in too little profit to provide electricity to rural areas. This is similar to the arguments that telecommunications companies make today about broadband services. Today, utility companies, municipalities and electric cooperatives are well-positioned to utilize their existing power grids and rights-of-way to build and maintain effective FTTx networks for delivering these new services to rural areas or non-metropolitan locations.Internet access will improve the quality of life, like electricity did back in the 1930s.<br />
        <br />
        AFL's <strong>FOLLOW THE POWER</strong><strong>® </strong><strong>service</strong> and <strong>PON ON PRIMARY<strong>®</strong> service </strong>simplifies fiber installation to a network that electric utilities know very well, which is their own power network. The electric utility power network from generation all the way to the consumer is very similar to a fiber network that can go as far as that same consumer. This service for fiber installation is not just for fiber-to-the-home networks that provide broadband to consumers either; it can be followed as deep into the network as needed for the specific application of the electric utility, cooperative or municipality</p>

        Electric utilities have relied on AFL for over 30 years. From <a href="/Markets/Energy/Transmission-and-Distribution.aspx">transmission</a> and <a href="/Markets/Energy/Substation.aspx">substation</a> accessories to <a href="/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable.aspx">cable</a> and <a href="/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Fiber-Optic-Cable-Hardware.aspx">fiber optic hardware</a>, AFL&rsquo;s solutions improve the reliability of critical electrical and optical infrastructure used for the transmission and distribution of electricity. That same infrastructure also supports <a href="/FTTX.aspx">FTTx networks</a> for delivering new services to electric utility customers.</p>
        <p>
        Increasing demand for high-speed applications is driving many utilities to invest in or expand upon fiber optic networks. In the 1930s, large electric companies claimed it was too expensive and would result in too little profit to provide electricity to rural areas. This is similar to the arguments that telecommunications companies make today about broadband services. Today, utility companies, municipalities and electric cooperatives are well-positioned to utilize their existing power grids and rights-of-way to build and maintain effective FTTx networks for delivering these new services to rural areas or non-metropolitan locations.&nbsp;Internet access will improve the quality of life, like electricity did back in the 1930s.<br />
        <br />
        AFL's <strong>FOLLOW THE POWER</strong><strong>&reg;</strong><strong>&nbsp;service</strong> simplifies fiber installation to a network that electric utilities know very well, which is their own power network. The electric utility power network from generation all the way to the consumer is very similar to a fiber network that can go as far as that same consumer. This service for fiber installation is not just for fiber-to-the-home networks that provide broadband to consumers either; it can be followed as deep into the network as needed for the specific application of the electric utility, cooperative or municipality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
