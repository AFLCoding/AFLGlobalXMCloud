        <div>
        Additionally AFL offers the industry’s most comprehensive line of <a href="/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Compression-Accessories" target="_blank">compression accessories</a> that operate–regardless of the electrical load–at a temperature lower than that of the conductor. Our compression accessories are designed for various applications including high temperatures, voltages up to 765 kV and heat dissipation. Conductors supported include ACSR, AAC, AAAC, ACAR, ACCC, EHS ACSR, AWAC, Alumoweld® and steel ground wire conductors. <br />
         </div>
        <div>
        To expand the reach of your network, AFL provides a robust solution that enables improved data capacity and transfer rates along the transmission and distribution systems. As the main communication path that controls utility systems, our optical cabling allows you to monitor power on the line, move power to avoid outages and brownouts, interact with substations and manage normal communications. That same infrastructure also supports FTTx networks for delivering new services to your customers. </div>

        Additionally AFL offers the industry&rsquo;s most comprehensive line of <a href="/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Compression-Accessories.aspx" target="_blank">compression accessories</a> that operate&ndash;regardless of the electrical load&ndash;at a temperature lower than that of the conductor. Our compression accessories are designed for various applications including high temperatures, voltages up to 765 kV and heat dissipation. Conductors supported include ACSR, AAC, AAAC, ACAR, ACCC, EHS ACSR, AWAC, Alumoweld&reg; and steel ground wire conductors.&nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
        To expand the reach of your network, AFL provides a robust solution that enables improved data capacity and transfer rates along the transmission and distribution systems. As the main communication path that controls utility systems, our optical cabling allows you to monitor power on the line, move power to avoid outages and brownouts, interact with substations and manage normal communications. That same infrastructure also supports FTTx networks for delivering new services to your customers.&nbsp;</div>
