        <p>As the first telecommunications company to offer a lifetime warranty* on end-to-end fiber optic systems, AFL partners with system integrators that possess the same quality of workmanship as we do. We carefully select partners that are as stringent about quality workmanship as we are at AFL. Plus, we are continually building our network of&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Contact/AFL-ACE-Partners.aspx" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;"> AFL Certified Expert (ACE) Installers</a> that design and install AFL systems.</p>
        <p>As an ACE Installer, you will be confident in designing and installing an AFL system that will fit the needs of your customers, as well as give them the peace of mind that a lifetime warranty offers. This, coupled with AFL&rsquo;s excellent technical support and the best products and solutions in the industry, will truly differentiate you from your competition.</p>
        <p>AFL offers each ACE Installer extensive hands-on training that will help you understand the products we manufacture better, as well as develop your fiber optic knowledge and installation practices.
