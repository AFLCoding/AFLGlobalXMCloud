        <p>One of the biggest obstacles to conducting a successful multi-site technology rollout, is driving consistently high quality performance when delivering a large volume of deployments, when using different field technicians at each site. Failure to achieve the right level of consistency is manifested as project schedule delays, overruns due to site revisits, and a poor end customer experience.</p>
        <p>Finding the right level of management for large-scale rollouts to ensure consistently high quality without introducing excessive cost, demands a proven system of methodologies and highly-skilled project management experts.</p>
        <p>The greatest challenge to success for volume rollouts is affordably achieving consistently high quality - at speed. Working with a proven technology rollout company, with the required methodologies, and with experienced project management personnel, addresses this challenge, and massively increases the probability for success.</p>
        <p>Your multi-site project is in good hands when AFL is on your team. Our professional project managers provide centralized command and control for even the most complex, multi-phased scopes of work.
