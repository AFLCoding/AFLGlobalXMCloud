        <p>Give employees, customers, contractors, and vendors the technologically advanced Audio/Visual (AV) experience they expect and value. AFL&rsquo;s professionals and trusted partners will help you assess your AV needs and analyze available products and services so that you can make the right decisions to address current and future requirements.</p>
        <p>AV and IT now merge and overlap so thoroughly that it&rsquo;s difficult to discern where AV ends and IT begins. Audio video integrated systems (also commonly referred to as AVIs) make it easier for businesses and educational facilities to communicate. These powerful, cost-effective tools offer solutions for the boardroom and the classroom alike.</p>
        <p>Let digital signage welcome visitors with meeting information. An integrated paging system in your building provides clear messaging, as mass notification in an emergency or dissemination of important information tailored to a few, or increase employee productivity by providing music or mask office noise.</p>
        <p>Whether your meetings are face-to-face or include people across the country or around the globe, fully integrated AV and IT give all attendees the engaging, informative, and uninterrupted experience you planned and prepared for.</p>
        <h2>The Modern Conference Room</h2>
        <p>You want to be as productive as possible in meetings and presentations with colleagues, vendors, and customers.

AFL will design, configure, and equip your meeting facilities to work seamlessly with modern technology to keep your business running efficiently through critical tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find and schedule available rooms.</li>
            <li>Select "Welcoming Room" parameters for your presentation.</li>
            <li>Support smart wireless presentation.</li>
            <li>Feature non-compromised 4K Video.</li>
            <li>Drop-in-place installation with minimum programming.</li>
