        <p>Today&rsquo;s application driven, internet based cloud environments are causing service providers to revisit and roll out new architectures.</p>
        <p>Delivering the exceptional value that your subscribers and customers expect starts with strong partnerships. A broad network of mutually beneficial alliances empowers service providers to deliver the creative solutions that meet these unique customer needs, as well as a commitment to innovation and collaboration. This is accomplished by partnering with select companies in various business verticals to help deliver these powerful solutions.</p>
        <p>As such a partner, AFL understands the demands on today&rsquo;s service providers. Our staff are specifically trained and operate as an extension to provide implementation and support services and customer integration solutions for our customers.</p>
