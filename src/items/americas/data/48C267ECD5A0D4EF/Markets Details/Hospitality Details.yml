        <p>When planning new installations, hotel design teams must consider the growing bandwidth requirements of today&rsquo;s business travelers and guests. These needs are no longer limited to just &lsquo;high speed internet access&rsquo;, but also include IP based phones, digital entertainment, and energy management systems. These applications require large amounts of bandwidth from the guestroom to the head end, and over a very reliable connection.</p>
        <p>Selecting a network services partner is critical to deploying a successful hospitality-based network. AFL&rsquo;s design and installation teams have experience in all aspects of the hospitality cabled infrastructure, including guestrooms, conference space, business centers, administrative offices, and hotel restaurants. We have the depth of knowledge, including a thorough understanding of the hospitality industries&rsquo; unique needs around digital entertainment, high-speed internet access, digital signage, and energy management.</p>
