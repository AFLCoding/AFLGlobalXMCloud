        <p>The trend across the manufacturing and process industries is clear: Network users expect higher reliability, faster speeds and wireless connectivity.</p>
        <p>Competitiveness is everything to manufacturers, and much-needed gains in efficiency and profitability will have to be achieved through new process innovations. This includes, for example, the continued automation of robots and warehouse transportation and cutting cables to become truly flexible. 5G and IoT will be key to enhancing and enabling these advances in manufacturing.</p>
        <p>Whether you need a new network or want to optimize or expand a network that you have, we offer experienced advice to assist you in reaching your productivity, performance, and security goals.</p>
        <p>AFL installers are trained in conducting Job Hazard Analysis prior to starting work to effectively identify and manage potentially dangerous site conditions. Lock Out/Tag Out procedures are used when working around hazardous equipment and overhead cranes. Field technicians are OSHA 10/30 trained and equipped to work safely in the most demanding environments requiring lift work, confined spaces, and job sites with hazardous materials and conditions.</p>
