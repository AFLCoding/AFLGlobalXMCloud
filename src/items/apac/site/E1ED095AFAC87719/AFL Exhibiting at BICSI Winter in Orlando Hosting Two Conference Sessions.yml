This technology reduces reburns and improves splice losses for fibers with poor cleave angles. Additionally, AFL will demo the <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/product-fusion-splicing/afl-launches-the-fujikura-90s-fusion-splicer-with-active-fusion-control-technology">Fujikura 90S+</a>, a single fiber core alignment fusion splicer with improved ergonomics and enhanced automation, plus the <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/news/afl-introduces-flowscout-pon-optical-power-meter">FlowScout PON optical power meter</a>, an essential tool for network activation, testing and troubleshooting of passive optical networks.<br />
