        Spartanburg, SC &ndash; <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an industry-leading manufacturer of specialty fibers, fiber optic cable, splicing and glass processing equipment and connectivity, is exhibiting at <a href="https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/photonics-west/exhibitions/bios-expo">SPIE BiOS</a> and <a href="https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/photonics-west/photonics-west-exhibition">Photonics West</a>, January 22-27, at The Moscone Center in San Francisco, Booth #8013 (BiOS) and 3013 (Photonics West). Products being showcased include the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/LAZERMaster%E2%93%87-LZM-125A-Splicing-System.aspx">LAZERMaster&reg; glass shaping and splicing system</a>, the <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/product-fusion-splicing-specialty/ldf-cleavers">Fujikura CT+ LDF cleavers</a> and <a href="https://learn.aflglobal.com/product-specialty-fiber/500-c-rated-optical-fibers-for-high-temperature-applications">500&deg;C metal-coated specialty optical fiber</a>. Join AFL representatives in the Demo Area for a <a href="https://spie.org/exhibitorDetail?expoid=2077&amp;exhibitorid=51078">LAZERMaster demonstration</a> and learn more about core alignment for Large Mode Area (LMA) fibers during a <a href="https://spie.org/photonics-west/presentation/Core-alignment-for-large-mode-area-LMA-fibers/11981-72">poster presentation session</a>. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        AFL&rsquo;s new <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Splicers/LAZERMaster%E2%93%87-LZM-125A-Splicing-System.aspx">LZM-125A+ LAZERMaster&reg; Splicing System</a> is a glass processor and fiber ablation machine that uses a CO<span style="font-size: 10px;">2</span>&nbsp;laser heat source to perform splicing, tapering, lensing ablation and other glass shaping operations with glass diameters from 80 &micro;m up to 2.0 mm. The high-resolution optical analysis system works in conjunction with on-board firmware for fully automatic glass shaping processes. The LZM-125 splicing system also includes a self-contained workstation.<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Cleavers.aspx">Fujikura LDF Cleavers</a> cleave fibers up to 1,250 &mu;m and provides both flat (CT-104+ and CT-105+) and angled cleaves (CT-106+) using an automatic clamping system with programmable force. The CT+ series has an automatic clamping force feature that quickly sets the optimum clamping force&mdash;critical for providing quality cleaves without damaging the fiber. The color LCD shows cleaving progress and recommended insert size depending on fiber coating and cladding diameter, and the USB port allows for saving and storing cleaving programs to a PC or tablet.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        AFL&rsquo;s 500&deg;C Metal-Coated Optical Fibers <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Specialty-Optical-Fiber/Specialty-Applications-Products/VHT500-Single-mode-Series.aspx">VHT500 single-mode</a> and <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Specialty-Optical-Fiber/Specialty-Applications-Products/VHT5000-Multimode-Series.aspx">VHT5000 multimode fibers</a> feature advanced glass chemistries for improved performance in hydrogen-rich environments, and excellent optical performance in permanent, long-term exposure to temperatures up to 500&deg;C.
