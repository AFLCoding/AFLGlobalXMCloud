        With decades of design and manufacturing expertise, our Dossert® product line offers a wide range of <a href="/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Substation-Accessories.aspx">substation accessories</a> for deployment by electric power utilities. Our substation products feature superior product performance designed to improve the reliability of the critical electrical and optical infrastructure used for the transmission and distribution of electricity.<br />
        <br />
        AFL's substation accessories are made for low voltage up to 765 kV applications that involve cable, pipe, flat or tubular bus and integral web connections. Substation accessories cover everything inside the fence including supports, couplers, connectors, expansions, taps, terminals, reducers, bus vibration dampers, stud connectors, end plugs and hardware.<br />
        <br />
        Complementing the entire substation family, Swage grounding, <a href="/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Substation-Accessories/Swage-Bus-Accessories.aspx">bus</a> and <a href="/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Substation-Accessories/Swage-Cable-Accessories.aspx">cable</a> accessories use a compression technology process called "swaging" that enables installation of aluminum accessories without the need for a welder. These Swage products allow the electric utility to install accessories faster and more efficiently, lowering installation costs. Swaging is the ideal solution for areas with shortages on qualified welders or when inclement weather conditions prohibit installation.<br />
        <br />
