        <strong>Spartanburg, SC</strong> - Employees at AFL Telecommunications in Duncan volunteered their time Saturday morning to assist at SCALE – the South Carolina Academic Learning Environment – located in Duncan on Danzler Road. Over the past two years, ice storms damaged the six-acre wooded lot limiting use of the site by the school district and community.  District Five needed help making it operational again and AFL was there to assist.<br />
        <br />
        Over thirty AFL volunteers as well as friends and family members gathered to pull and chop weeds, mow the grass, blow the trails, and pick up limbs and other debris. Most of the work was focused on the amphitheatre and gazebo areas as well as areas close to Danzler Road. <br />
        <br />
        The volunteer effort was part of AFL's SPIRIT grant which matches the “sweat equity” of AFL’s employees with a $3,000 grant to SCALE. Corie Culp, AFL's Community Relations Manager, presented the check to Greg Wood, Assistant Superintendent of Administration and Operations for District Five Schools of Spartanburg County.<br />
        <br />
        “The amount of work accomplished Saturday morning was more than I expected,” stated Wood. “With the help of AFL's employees, family and friends, we will make SCALE operational again and host not only our schools, but also our community. The grant will help us continue our restoration project.”<br />
        <br />
        Located near Duncan Elementary and Byrnes High School, SCALE is a map of the state of South Carolina perched within six beautiful, wooded acres. An outdoor facility used by students and faculty, the area engages students in various disciplines including science, geography, history, and the environment – just to name a few.  The outdoor classroom is open to students in all Spartanburg school districts as well as across the state, enabling them to learn in a peaceful setting.<br />
