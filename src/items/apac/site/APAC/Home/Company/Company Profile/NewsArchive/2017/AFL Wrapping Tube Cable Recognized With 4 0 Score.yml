        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading global fiber optics manufacturer and service provider, was recognized by the 2017 Lightwave Innovation Reviews with a score of 4 out of 5 possible points, for its <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=700FA7F356564DF8AA34C82971BFE193&_z=z">Wrapping Tube Cable</a> (WTC) with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E545E2A90D414F31BDD0BA9B8ED27FD0&_z=z">SpiderWeb® Ribbon</a> (SWR) technology.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC) is an ultra-high density outside plant cable designed for FTTH or access markets. Using SpiderWeb ribbon technology, WTC provides the smallest cable diameter and lowest weight, high-fiber count ribbon cable in the industry. WTC is available in dielectric or double jacket single armor with fiber counts from 144 to 1,728.<br />
        <br />
        “This new cable technology provides innovative product solutions for any customer building high density fiber optic access networks or point-to-point networks by significantly reducing the cost of the build with a new collapsible ribbon technology and dry core cable technology,” explained Patrick Dobbins, director of solutions engineering for AFL. “These key cable attributes significantly reduce the cable diameter and cable weight allowing for the most efficient use of cable pathways such as underground duct systems and aerial.”<br />
        <br />
        Presented annually by Lightwave, the Lightwave Innovation Reviews program distinguishes top products and solutions available within the optical networking industry as determined by a stellar panel of third-party judges. Judges include industry executives and analysts from a wide variety of service providers, technology developers, industry analysts and journalists.<br />
        <br />
        The Innovation Reviews are judged based on originality, innovation, positive impact on the customer, how well it addresses a new or existing requirement, novelty of approach and cost-effectiveness.<br />
