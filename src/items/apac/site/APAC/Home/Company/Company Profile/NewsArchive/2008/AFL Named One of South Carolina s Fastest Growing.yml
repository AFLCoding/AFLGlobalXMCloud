        Spartanburg, SC - AFL was honored as one of the Palmetto's state's top-performing companies during the presentation of the South Carolina's Fastest-Growing Companies 2008 program's Top 25 winners. The winners were announced during the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce's Annual Summit luncheon held at the Wild Dunes Resort near Charleston, S.C. on November 13, 2008.<br />
        <br />
        The South Carolina's Fastest-Growing Companies program, co-sponsored by Elliott Davis, LLC and the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, recognizes an exceptional and diverse assembly of businesses from across the state. This year's winners represent a cross section of industries and business categories, including: financial services, construction, manufacturing, professional services, and technology among others.<br />
        <br />
        Headquartered in Spartanburg, S.C., AFL, a leading fiber optic cable and accessories manufacturer, ranked #20 out of 25 fastest-growing companies in South Carolina. Employing over 500 in Spartanburg and over 3,000 worldwide, AFL's products and services impact various industries including telecommunications, broadband, private network, electric utility, and wireless as well as emerging markets such as oil and gas, mining and medical.<br />
        <br />
        Accepting this award on behalf of AFL was Corie Culp, community relations manager. "Manufacturing is an integral part of the state's economy and we're honored to be significant part of the growth in South Carolina," stated Culp. "Through internal and external collaboration and teamwork, setting challenging and sustainable goals, and constantly researching new, emerging markets, continued growth will be realized not only for AFL, but also for companies statewide."<br />
        <br />
        Otis Rawl, president and chief executive officer of program co-sponsor South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, thinks this success in the midst of somewhat troubling times is encouraging.<br />
        <br />
        "It is so important to the growth of our state that we continue to have companies that persevere through all kinds of economic weather," Rawl said. "I'm proud to be a part of a program that celebrates such an outstanding group of entrepreneurs and business owners, who continue to rise to the top."<br />
        <br />
        For the past seven years, Elliott Davis and the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce have named a list of 25 entities as South Carolina's Fastest-Growing Companies, chosen for percentage increases in both gross revenue (or assets) and full-time employment over the previous fiscal year.<br />
        <br />
        But as the landscape of South Carolina business evolves, so should the contest, according to Buster Kennedy, Elliott Davis marketing manager and director of the competition.<br />
        <br />
        South Carolina's local companies continue thrive, but the Palmetto State is also a top destination for national and even international corporations. With fledgling ventures, multi-million-dollar conglomerates and those in between, in the 2008 list the dollar revenue growth and number of jobs added, in addition to the percentage growth, was considered. Elliott David determined the new method better compares small and large companies, and more accurately represents the diverse stories of South Carolina business.<br />
