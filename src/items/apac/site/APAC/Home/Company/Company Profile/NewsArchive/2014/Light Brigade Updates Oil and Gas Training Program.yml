        Tukwila, WA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.lightbrigade.com/Home.aspx">Light Brigade</a>, <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>’s education and training division, has updated its <a href="https://www.lightbrigade.com/Training-Courses/Fiber-Optics-for-Oil-and-Gas.aspx">oil and gas training program</a>, increasing classroom and hands-on training to four days and featuring new chapters on fiber optic sensing theory and sensing applications.<br />
         <br />
        The improved oil and gas training course contains 16 hours of in-classroom training and 16 hours of hands-on training with experienced instructors in the fiber optic industry. Students will use the latest fiber optic equipment to learn how to splice, connectorize, test and troubleshoot petrochemical-based optical fiber networks in order to increase efficiency, reliability and on-the-job safety requirements as well as reduce overall production cost and facilities downtime.<br />
         <br />
        “Usage of fiber optic sensors in oil and gas applications is exploding,” said Dario De Paolis, vice president and general manager of Light Brigade. “By expanding this course, we enable students to gain in-depth knowledge on how optical sensing is revolutionizing the industry and receive additional hands-on skills training.”<br />
         <br />
        Light Brigade’s training program features professional animations that demonstrate concepts that are difficult to see in the field and instruction on how fiber optic sensors can monitor integrity, flow and security. Other topics include pipelines, refineries and how to test, troubleshoot and terminate optical fibers for communications and monitoring equipment, including harsh environment cables and fibers.<br />
