        In October, AFL associates around the world celebrated the fifth annual Worldwide Week of Service. During this week, associates around the globe engaged in their communities providing services and giving back. In Spartanburg, associates were a part of several activities where generosity shined!<br />
        <br />
        The Week of Service kicked off with a competition food drive that supported District Five Family Ministries (D5FM) in Spartanburg. Associates dropped off donations in large buckets labeled with different team names, sparking a bit of friendly competition. Ultimately, the winner was D5FM who received loads of non-perishable items to support our neighbors in need.<br />
        <br />
        On Thursday, AFL associates raised close to $7,000 in support of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society® Light the Night® and walked in memory, in honor or in support of a loved one. Over 70 AFL donors including friends and family came out that evening to Furman University to participate in the walk. With a sponsorship of $2,500 made possible by AFL’s Community Outreach Program, close to $10K was provided to LLS in support of its mission. In addition, AFL earned second place in corporate donations this year.<br />
        <br />
        Lastly, AFL volunteers participated in an ACT (AFL Community Team) project, supporting Project HOPE Foundation, an organization that supports children with autism and their families in the upstate. Volunteers worked an exchange station at the annual fundraising relay event, supporting runners as they ran grueling hilly terrain! AFL volunteers presented a $3,000 grant to the organization made possible by AFL’s Community Outreach Program. AFL volunteers won “Most Enthusiastic Exchange Station” as well as top fundraiser/contributor for this year’s race.<br />
        <br />
        AFL locations around the world also participated in the worldwide week of service. AFL’s Swindon, UK participated in “coffee morning” to raise funds for MacMillan Cancer Support, an organization that provides practical, medical and financial support for better cancer care. Over $1,600 was raised through the cake sale and AFL matching funds.<br />
        <br />
        Associates in Monterrey, Mexico participated in an ACT project that supported a local school by painting the rooms, wall to ceiling, and installing roof insulation. Thirty AFL volunteers plus friends and family volunteered that day. AFL’s Community Outreach Program provided a $3,000 grant to help with supplies needed that day.<br />
        <br />
        AFL associates in Monroe, NC partnered with the Alliance for Children, an organization dedicated to helping teen mothers stay in school. Associates donated to the “Diaper and Wipe Drive.” AFL Belmont (NH) and Lowell (MA) associates donated gently used and new coats to benefit the homeless in both communities as well as canned food to local food pantries.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Community Outreach program consists of several initiatives—all with the same goal: to make a positive difference in the lives of others. Through grants, employee engagement programs, environmental initiatives and more, AFL imagines communities that are strong and thriving.
