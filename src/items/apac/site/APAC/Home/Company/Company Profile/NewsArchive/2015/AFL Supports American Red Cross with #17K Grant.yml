        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, a leading global fiber optics manufacturer and service provider, presented a $17,000 grant to the American Red Cross of the Palmetto SC Region to support those affected by the October flooding in the Carolinas. The grant was made possible by AFL’s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a> and AFL associates. For every $1 donated to the American Red Cross by associates, AFL supplemented their donation with $2, resulting in the $17,000 donation.<br />
         <br />
        “The flooding that took place in the Carolinas impacted thousands of South Carolina citizens, displacing families, ruining homes and killing individuals,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “AFL associates proved to be generous again in a great time of need.”<br />
         <br />
        Torrential rain from a front system combined with the outer band from Hurricane Joaquin dumped over 20 inches of rain in some areas of the state. South Carolina was in a national scale disaster relief effort and recovery for most of the month. The Red Cross response in South Carolina included serving more than 154,000 meals and snacks, providing more than 4,500 overnight shelter stays and distributing more than 181,000 relief items.<br />
        <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants, sponsorships, employee engagement projects, disaster relief and more.
