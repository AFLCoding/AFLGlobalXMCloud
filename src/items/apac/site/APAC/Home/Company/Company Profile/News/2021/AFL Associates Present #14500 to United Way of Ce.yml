        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a provider of engineering and installation services, and manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, presented $14,500 to the&nbsp;<a href="https://uwcentralcarolinas.org/">United Way of Central Carolinas</a>&nbsp;at the culmination of its annual United Way campaign. The donation was made possible by AFL associates&rsquo; donations to the campaign, plus AFL&rsquo;s matching program which added up to $100 per donation.<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;This annual campaign is an opportunity for each individual to make a difference in our community,&rdquo; commented Seneca Mullins, senior vice president of AFL&rsquo;s Enterprise Services and ITC president. &ldquo;At a time when organization&rsquo;s resources have declined, our associates learned about the need in our community and acted.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        The campaign theme was &ldquo;Global Games&mdash;Give for the Gold,&rdquo; a nod to the Tokyo Games. During the two-week campaign, associates make a financial contribution for the betterment of their community. AFL&rsquo;s Monroe associates realized a 123 percent increase in campaign contributions over the previous year and a 22 percent increase in the number of donors.<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;We are so grateful for the incredible partnership with AFL,&rdquo; said Ivy Allen, Regional Development Director for United Way of Central Carolinas. &ldquo;Their continued support of United Way and the community is making a positive impact and providing hope and opportunities to many of our children, families, and individuals.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://uwcentralcarolinas.org/">United Way of Central Carolinas</a>&nbsp;fights for the education, health and financial stability of every person in their community, supporting nonprofit organizations that maintain the safety net, advance racial equity and create equitable access to opportunity. United Way of Central Carolinas brings together groups to address complex challenges facing individuals, families and communities across the Charlotte region. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Locations worldwide conducted campaigns during the month of June, generating $670,000 for AFL communities worldwide. This is a 36 percent increase over 2020 and a 27 percent increase in the number of donors.<br />
