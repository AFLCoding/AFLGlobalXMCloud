        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a> was the recipient of three <a href="http://www.myscma.com/">South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance</a> (SCMA) awards for outstanding workplace safety accomplishments in 2015. Recipients of SCMA’s safety performance awards must have an injury rate (restricted and lost workday) that is below the state’s average.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Ridgeview, Hidden Lake and USAC facilities in Spartanburg met or exceeded the requirements to earn this award by having a low rate of injuries resulting in lost workdays, job transfers or job restrictions. Additionally, AFL’s Ridgeview manufacturing facility was presented with an award for having one of state’s top three highest number-of-hours worked without a lost workday injury of 4.8 million.<br />
        <br />
        “Our associates are the backbone of our safety program,” commented Don Heatherly, AFL’s Environmental Health and Safety manager in Spartanburg. “Each day they are committed to ensuring the safety of themselves and their colleagues. Our goal is zero-injuries in the workplace.”<br />
        <br />
        The management of <a href="/Company/Environment-Health-and-Safety">environment, health and safety</a> is one of AFL’s core values. As a priority area of accountability, associates are required to undergo training, inspections, and audits to ensure conformance to AFL’s safety policies. Compliance to these policies is a condition of employment.<br />
