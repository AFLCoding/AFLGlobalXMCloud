        AFL matched dollar-for-dollar all donations made by AFL and ECSite clients, customers, partners and associates, ultimately providing $25,000 to the Help India Breathe campaign through the&nbsp;<a href="https://tnfusa.org/" style="color: #0091ea; background-color: transparent;">Tamil Nadu Foundation</a>, a grassroots nonprofit organization actively involved in COVID-19 relief efforts in India. The donation was made in memory of two immediate family members of ECSite employees lost to COVID and has since been named the &ldquo;Sekar and Sathiyagreeswaran Memorial Fund.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;We have many employees based in India, so the COVID-19 crisis during the second wave impacted us directly. We knew we had to do something to give back to the community, and the &lsquo;Help India Breathe&rsquo; campaign enabled us to do just that,&rdquo; said Subbu Meiyappan, CEO and Founder of ECSite. &ldquo;The campaign allowed us to collaborate with customers, partners and employees impacted by the COVID-19 crisis in India. We are grateful to all the donors who donated in a timely manner and AFL&rsquo;s generous 1-1 matching donation. The &lsquo;Sekar and Sathiyagreeswaran Memorial Fund&rsquo; will provide relief efforts that are sorely needed and demonstrate our collective commitment to doing the right thing in business and through pro-social efforts.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        The crisis in India impacted both Fujikura, AFL&rsquo;s parent company, and AFL families, specifically associates with AFL India and business partners ECSite and Sasmos, AFL&rsquo;s Indian manufacturing partner.<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;True to the AFL culture, we had the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others and stepped in to provide funding to aid health care workers and residents during a dire time of need,&rdquo; explained Kent Brown, vice president of strategic planning. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honor to work for a company that is compassionate about our neighbors, not only here but also abroad.&rdquo;<br />
