        Spartanburg, SC - AFL announces newly designed 12 and 24-fiber wall-mount patch panels, offering a compact convergence point with options that make this product truly unique! Featuring a clean and secure optical path exiting the enclosure, the LGX® compatible panel fits comfortably into new and existing interconnect, cross-connect and co-location environments, without compromising the bend radius of jumpers.<br />
        <br />
        “In designing this patch panel, we took into consideration what our customers have requested,” stated Chuck Turner, Product Manager for AFL. “With this in mind, we developed a panel with a footprint 30% smaller than our previous versions, yet with enough internal working area so as not to adversely affect the bend radius of jumpers within the panel – even when incorporating an in-line attenuator.”<br />
        <br />
        In addition, the new patch panel can be provisioned with an optional 5-position Keystone® adapter panel, making it compatible with common locally available copper interconnect products. The wall-mount patch panel features a robust steel construction and dual access doors with separate locking options, expanding the products versatility into many different applications. Offered empty, with adapters or fully loaded with pre-terminated assemblies, the modular panel is also available with various connector styles and an optional splice tray and holder.<br />
