Used on PON networks such as BPON, EPON, GPON, 10G-EPON, XG-PON, XGS-PON and video,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Optical-Loss-Testing/Optical-Power-Meters/FlowScout-PON-Optical-Power-Meters.aspx">FlowScout</a>&nbsp;automatically detects up to five wavelengths and measures power in a few seconds. The power meter includes a visual aid to help technicians choose the right testing location to ensure the appropriate testing limits.<br />
        &ldquo;FTTx/PON has become the technology of choice to meet the exploding bandwidth needs for homes, businesses and 5G backhaul. As telcos, cable operators and rural networks around the world deploy 10G PONs, and with XGS-PON leading the pack, AFL provides a variety of testing tools to build, activate and troubleshoot PON networks,&rdquo; noted Al Swanson, general manager of AFL&rsquo;s equipment business. &ldquo;FlowScout becomes the latest addition to our wide variety of FTTx tools in our portfolio.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        Additional features of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Optical-Loss-Testing/Optical-Power-Meters/FlowScout-PON-Optical-Power-Meters.aspx">FlowScout PON Optical Power Meter</a>&nbsp;include:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Detects multiple wavelengths automatically with no setup required!</li>
            <li>Simultaneously detects and measures upstream and downstream GPON, XGS-PON and video signals</li>
            <li>Evaluates and displays pass/fail status relative to expected min/max signal levels</li>
            <li>Optional field-swappable Port Saver connector adapters</li>
            <li>Large daylight viewable color touchscreen display</li>
            <li>Rugged and water resistant IP54 rating</li>
            <li>Rechargeable Li-Polymer battery</li>
        </ul>
        &ldquo;FlowScout is the easiest way to verify PON network power levels,&rdquo; explained Arun Jain, director of product marketing for AFL.&nbsp; &ldquo;All a technician has to do is plug in the fiber and it detects multiple wavelengths automatically. No setup is required, no need for referencing and no buttons to press. It is completely automated.&rdquo;<br />
