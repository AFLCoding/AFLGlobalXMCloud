        Spartanburg, SC –<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>announces it is releasing a host of new test and inspection equipment at this year’s<a href="https://www.bicsi.org/fall/2015/default.aspx">BICSI Fall Conference and Expo</a>in Las Vegas, Sept. 21-23. Visit AFL in booth #143 to see demonstrations of new products including aeRos™, a cloud-based management system, Rogue™, a modular test platform, and<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/Singlemode-OTDRs-Fault-Locators-Telco-Broadband/FlexScan-OTDR.aspx">FlexScan OTDR</a>.<br />
        <br />
        aeRos is AFL’s new cloud-based, workflow and data management platform designed completely around the way service providers build, operate and maintain networks. aeRos provides a seamless two-way communication and data exchange from engineering to project management to technicians in the field. Rogue is a flexible, modular test platform that enables users to choose the functionality needed. By pairing Rogue modules with apps running on a smart device, users can create the test capability that a technician requires for a specific job.<br />
        <br />
        AFL will also showcase the<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/Singlemode-OTDRs-Fault-Locators-Telco-Broadband/FlexScan-OTDR.aspx">FlexScan OTDR</a>with LinkMap™ and SmartAuto™. FlexScan enables technicians to quickly and easily troubleshoot faulty optical networks, or completely characterize newly installed networks. The SmartAuto technology automatically selects the most appropriate OTDR settings to detect, locate, identify and measure network start, end, connectors, splices and macro-bends. LinkMap technology applies pass/fail limits to detected events, displays the network using color-coded icons to highlight faults and recommends corrective action to resolve faults.<br />
        <br />
        AFL will also feature several of its enterprise products and services including its fiber management system, fiber optic cable, connectors, fusion splicers and Light Brigade™ training and education.
