        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, a leading global fiber optics manufacturer and service provider, presented a $7,500 grant to the <a href="http://www.redcross.org/local/south-carolina">Palmetto SC Region of the American Red Cross</a> in support of those affected by Hurricane Matthew along the southeast coast and in the Caribbean. The grant was made possible by AFL associates and AFL’s <a href="/Company/Community">Community Outreach Program</a> which matched each associate’s donation dollar for dollar to the American Red Cross.<br />
         <br />
        “The devastation was vast and many lives were lost. The path of destruction is still noticeable and cleanup continues,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Our associates were generous—not only donating to families affected in the United States but also the Caribbean.”<br />
         <br />
        Hurricane Matthew intensified over the Caribbean and brought destruction and loss of life through Haiti, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and southeastern United States. More than 1,600 deaths were attributed to the storm. In the U.S. alone, the American Red Cross was quick to respond, providing more than 854,000 meals and snacks, 92,000 overnight stays and distributing more than 178,000 relief items.<br />
         <br />
        AFL has an extensive <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a> that provides grants, sponsorships, employee engagement projects, disaster relief and more.
