        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> presented the 2018-2019 <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=19332D89F65248E08A271CAFF52B718D&_z=z">Naruse Academic Scholarship</a> award to Julia McElhinny, daughter of Steve McElhinny, IT Director in AFL’s Information Technology department. The award recognizes students with outstanding academic achievement, initiative and community service.<br />
        <br />
        Graduating as the valedictorian of her class, Julia is a National Merit Scholarship Corporation Finalist, a U.S. Presidential Scholar Candidate and a National AP Scholar. She has been active in the National Beta Club, Key Club, Spanish Honors Society and National Honor Society. Julia has also been an involved member of her community, performing over 400 hours of volunteer service with multiple local organizations.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to her dedication to academics and community service, Julia also received varsity letters in Cross Country and Swimming. Julia has been a year-round swimmer since the age of nine, and has qualified for the South Carolina Swimming State Championships and USA Swimming Southern Zone Sectionals on numerous occasions. During her summers, Julia has worked as a swim league coach and a swim lesson instructor for young children.  <br />
        <br />
        Julia plans to attend Wake Forest University this fall to continue her education in Environmental Science and Biology on a track toward Public Health at the graduate level. She wants to research the effects of human activities on the environment and how these changes are negatively impacting humans across the globe. Public Health will allow her to work in health services with a strong emphasis in STEM-based research. She’s currently interested in pursuing Environmental Health, Epidemiology and/or Biostatistics. These fields combine her interests in math and science with her love for service to others.<br />
        <br />
        Each year, AFL awards a four-year scholarship to the son or daughter of a North American-based AFL associate entering a college or university. The scholarship was named in memory of Toshihide Naruse, Managing Director of Fujikura, AFL’s parent company. Mr. Naruse’s contributions to AFL were significant, and because of his personal interest in higher education, AFL continues to honor his memory.<br />
