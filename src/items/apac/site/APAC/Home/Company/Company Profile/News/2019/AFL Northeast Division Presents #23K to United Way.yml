        <div>Westford, MA and Spartanburg, SC – June 26, 2019 – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a global manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, wrapped up its annual United Way campaign with a $23K donation to the community. Made possible by AFL associates and AFL’s matching program, donations increased by 35 percent over the previous year. Both <a href="http://www.graniteuw.org/">Granite United Way</a> and <a href="https://unitedwaymassbay.org/">United Way of Massachusetts Bay and Merrimack Valley</a> were recipients.
        “This annual campaign is a large part of our community outreach efforts worldwide,” commented David LeBlanc, general manager for AFL’s Test & Inspection division. “Our associates live our Core Value of Community Engagement and it shows through their volunteerism and philanthropy.”<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://www.graniteuw.org/">Granite United Way</a>, located in New Hampshire, received $9,000 and <a href="https://unitedwaymassbay.org/">United Way of Massachusetts Bay and Merrimack Valley</a>, located in Massachusetts, received $14,000.<br />
        <br />
        Each year, AFL’s campaign committee determines a theme. This year’s theme was “Game On!”—a gaming theme which resonated with many associates. To kick off the campaign, United Way representatives meet with associates to talk about their organization. A local nonprofit, funded by United Way, also shared its mission and how United Way impacts them.<br />
        <br />
        “Our community has so much to offer,” commented Nancy Kiklis, human resources manager for AFL’s Test & Inspection division. “It’s important that they hear from both United Way and a funded agency to fully grasp the impact.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL runs this campaign worldwide during the month of May. Worldwide the campaign is known as Imagine That! and provided $506K to AFL communities worldwide.<br />
        <br />
