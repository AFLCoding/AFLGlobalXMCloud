        <div>Kent, WA and Spartanburg, SC – Light Brigade, AFL’s industry-leading training and education division, is introducing a large selection of live, remote training options. The new Remote Classroom Sessions deliver personalized training in a convenient and essential live, online learning format.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Remote Classroom Sessions focus on fiber optic technology topics from beginner to advanced, allowing students to personalize their training. Students can target their learning on the basics with Fiber Optics 1-2-3 sessions, participate in refresher learning or take the next step with advanced topics like Emergency Restoration, FTTx networks or Fiber Characterization. Several sessions provide the flexibility of morning or afternoon training.<br />
        <br />
        Remote Classroom Sessions are taught live by the same experienced instructors that lead Light Brigade’s classroom training. Students can interact and ask questions that are answered in real-time by a fiber technologist.<br />
        <br />
        “With the current COVID-19 situation forcing many to work from home and unable to attend in-person classes, our customers wanted other options to continue training their staff,” explained Lee Kellett, general manager of Light Brigade. “We quickly responded, updating our remote class offerings to include more topics delivered in shorter sessions, and provided additional start time options. With these sessions conducted with a live instructor, our customers will recieve the best training experience possible.”<br />
        <br />
        The individualized alternative of these shorter training sessions can save both time and money. Students can take a few courses or complete session bundles and use the credits for future ETA® Certification and BICSI® credits.<br />
        <br />
