        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a global manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, completed its annual United Way campaign, presenting a $376,000 donation to <a href="http://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a>. The campaign, which usually takes place late Spring, was postponed until early Fall due to the pandemic. However, with an abbreviated campaign over the summer and its recent extensive campaign, associates rallied in support of the local community.<br />
        <br />
        “With our communities facing incredible challenges today, our associates demonstrated their generosity in a time of greater need,” commented Jody Gallagher, president and CEO of AFL. “Our Core Value of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&_z=z">Community Engagement</a> was lived out by each donor’s choice to change the life of another individual by personally donating through this campaign. I am grateful for their commitment.” <br />
        <br />
        The campaign’s theme was aptly titled “Stronger Together.” Several organizations in the Upstate of South Carolina sent in short video clips of their executive directors, presidents and CEOs, answering one question, “Why United Way?” The video montage was showcased through online meetings, on breakroom monitors and over AFL’s intranet, and told a story of the importance of United Way in the community.<br />
        <br />
        “There’s a saying that ‘true character is revealed in a crisis,’” said Kurt Dallas, president of AFL Product Solutions. “The character of our associates prevailed. I’m proud of the AFL team and how they stepped up to support our neighbors.”<br />
        <br />
        Locations throughout the United States conducted United Way campaigns during September, generating more than $440,000 in donations within eight states. The United Way is part of a larger international campaign called “Imagine That!” Results from the entire campaign will be announced at the end of October.<br />
        <br />
