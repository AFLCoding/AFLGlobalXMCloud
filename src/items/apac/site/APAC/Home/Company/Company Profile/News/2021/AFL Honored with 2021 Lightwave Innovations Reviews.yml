        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, announced today that two products were recognized among the best by the 2021 Lightwave innovation Reviews. The&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2E8A1E84DF684525BB00EFB67133746A&amp;_z=z">Fujikura 90R mass fusion splicer</a>&nbsp;and the new&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=BD16F0851A334911A1C25E3194A9D166&amp;_z=z">Apex&trade; splice closure</a>&nbsp;received a 4.5 and 4.0 ranking, respectively. The third-party judging panel included experts from a wide variety of service providers, technology developers, industry analysis firms and the media. Entries were reviewed based on criteria including originality, innovation, positive impact on the customer, how well the product addresses a new or existing requirement, novelty of approach and cost-effectiveness.<br />
        Ideal for mass fusion splicing, the&nbsp;Fujikura 90R&nbsp;features ergonomic improvements and automation designed to maximize productivity in the field. With an automated splice start, tube heater, wind protector and blade rotations, the 90R gives operators additional time for other fiber preparation steps. The fusion splicer is provided with a spare 12-fiber V-groove and electrode assembly which can be quickly exchanged in the field. Additional features include cleaver tracking and upkeep with wireless communication; 200 &micro;m and 250 &micro;m SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg; universal ribbon prep accessories, a 5.0&rdquo; touchscreen and multi-function transit case.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />

        &nbsp;<br />
        Launched in December 2020, the Apex splice closure line is designed to ease usability, decrease installation time, improve network reliability and increase the density of fiber splices, especially when coupled with AFL&rsquo;s industry-leading high-density MicroCore&reg; cable and&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=740F36E4074A417CBAB68839104B5517&amp;_z=z">Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC) with SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg; (SWR&reg;)</a>. The closure is smaller in size yet provides for higher densities making it easier to maximize available space when space is a premium. With a wedge-based sealing system, a cable can be installed into the closure and sealed in seconds, reducing overall installation time. The universal splice holder module eliminates the need to stock different splice trays or splice holders for different jobs.<br />
