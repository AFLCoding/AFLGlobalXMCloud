        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a> is expanding its All-Dielectric Self-Supporting (<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/ADSS.aspx">ADSS</a>) product line with the introduction of <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/ADSS/Flex-Span/Flex-Span-ADSS-Fiber-Optic-Cable.aspx">Flex-Span ADSS</a>, an aerial fiber optic cable engineered for the most demanding environmental conditions. Flex-Span allows for a broader combination of fiber counts and span lengths, providing greater flexibility in product selection and design options.<br />
        <br />
        “As AFL expanded its ADSS cable solution, we focused on the needs of our customers,” commented Jon Potter, product manager for AFL’s cable line. “Flex-Span is a customizable, highly optimized solution that is easy-to-use and ideal for aerial applications where short to mid-span length is needed.”<br />
        <br />
        With Flex-Span, network installation efficiency is optimized. Similar to standard ADSS, Flex-Span uses dry-core technology and contains gel-filled buffer tubes that are S-Z stranded for easy mid-span access. Flex-Span requires no support or messenger wire easing installation.<br />
        <br />
        Flex-Span is available with up to 144 fibers and any type or combination of single-mode or multimode fibers within the cable. Span lengths are between 50 to 1100 feet and recommended for use with helical wrap style hardware.<br />
