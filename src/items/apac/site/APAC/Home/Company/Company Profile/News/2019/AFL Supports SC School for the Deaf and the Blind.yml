        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, presented a $7,500 grant to the <a href="https://www.scsdb.org/page/344">South Carolina School for the Deaf and the Blind (SCSDB) Foundation</a>, an organization dedicated to supporting the <a href="https://www.scsdb.org/">SCSDB</a> by raising funds and building relationships. This grant will help expand Einstein’s Workshop—a MakerSpace program designed to emphasize learning and exploring STEM—by providing a multi-touch interactive table and software to expand opportunities for students.<br />
        “The students and teachers at the SC School for the Deaf and the Blind used Einstein’s Workshop last school year and they absolutely love it,” commented Weslie Higdon, grants coordinator for SCSDB Foundation. “With the new multi-touch table, Einstein’s Workshop will now provide our students with something vital to their future: experience.”<br />
        <br />
        Because the work accomplished in Einstein’s Workshop using the multi-touch table is hands-on, the students can engage in exploration, asking questions and finding the answer themselves. Additionally, the multi-touch table will allow teachers to expand the technological education students need to succeed.<br />
        <br />
        Higdon continued, “Our objective in expanding Einstein’s Workshop is to continue to give students a solid foundation in important principles that will lead them into a STEM-focused area in high school and beyond.”<br />
        <br />
        Einstein’s Workshop is the only specialized school in South Carolina for children who are deaf, blind and sensory multi-disabled. The Workshop was established to expose students to new STEM concepts and give them the opportunity to explore them.   <br />
