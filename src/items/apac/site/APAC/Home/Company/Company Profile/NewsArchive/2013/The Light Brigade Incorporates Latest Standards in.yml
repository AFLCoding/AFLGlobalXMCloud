        <p>Tukwila, WA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /Services/Training/The-Light-Brigade ">The Light Brigade</a>, <a href=" /">AFL</a>’s education and training division, has incorporated the content of the ANSI Z 136.2 standard along with the international IEC 60825-2 optical fiber communications safety standard to its <a href="http://www.lightbrigade.com/store/product.php?productid=1990&cat=76&page=1">Fiber Optic Safety DVD</a>. The new ANSI standard provides guidance for the safe use, maintenance, service and installation of fiber optic and free space optical communications systems which use laser diodes that operate between standard wavelengths of 850-1650 nm. The standard is applicable for those who assemble, service or maintain end-to-end fiber optic communication systems and optical components.<br />
        <br />
        “As installers build and test a system, awareness of possible risks is crucial,” stated Ron Peterson, Chairman of the Standards Subcommittee (SSC-2) under the NSIASC, and who also spearheaded the team that crafted the guidelines.<br />
        <br />
        The standard is published by the Laser Institute of America (LIA), a recognized industry leader in laser advocacy and safety education. To order the ANSI Z136.2 standard (ISBN# 978-0-912035-68-0), visit <a href="http://www.lia.org/ANSI">www.lia.org/ANSI</a> or call LIA at 1.800.34.LASER.<br />

        The Light Brigade’s <a href="http://www.lightbrigade.com/store/product.php?productid=1990&cat=76&page=1">Fiber Optic Safety DVD</a><strong></strong>serves as a training tool to help enhance the fiber optic safety program for anyone who works with optical fibers or lasers or who installs or operates fiber optic communication systems. The DVD’s 10 menu-selectable chapters focus on topics relevant to today’s fiber technicians, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p>Laser types and classifications, how they operate and various control measures</p>

            </li>
            <li>
            <p>The impact of high-power Raman and EDFA optical amplifiers</p>

            <li>
            <p>Safety practices during installation and restoration</p>
            </li>
            <li>

        <p>Bonus materials provided on the DVD include a student quiz with matching instructor version, written in Microsoft® Word format, which allows customization for specific safety needs. <a href="https://www.bicsi.org/Default ">BICSI</a>® recognizes Fiber Optic Safety DVD training for the following BICSI Continuing Education Credits (CECs): one RCDD; one RITP; one Installer 2, one Technician and one Certified Trainer.<br />
