        Swindon, UK and Spartanburg, SC, USA – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> presented <a href="http://www.dressability.org.uk/">Dressability</a> a £1,565 grant made possible by <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">AFL’s Community Outreach Program</a>. Dressability has been providing alterations services for people with physical disabilities and learning difficulties since 1998. The grant will provide equipment essential dressmaking and clothing alteration services.<br />
        <br />
        “Dressability aims to make life easier by making their clothing work better for people with physical disabilities,” stated Sian Barrie, manager and cofounder of Dressability. “Most garments are designed for mobile people of standard sizes who have a normal body shape. Due to a wide range of disabilities, our clients do not fall into these categories. For example, zips and buttons are difficult to manage for people with dexterity problems and pulling clothes over the head is awkward for those with limited mobility in neck and shoulders.”<br />
        <br />
        For people with physical and/or learning difficulties, young people with behavioural difficulties and their family or carers, the daily activity of dressing and undressing can be painful, time-consuming, frustrating and stressful. Last year, Dressability helped 473 people between the ages of four and 93 in the Swindon and surrounding areas.<br />
        <br />
        “Dressability provides valuable services for people who have difficulties with standard ‘off the rail’ shop clothing, but who still deserve to have the same choice of style and elegance,” stated Margaret Harman, AFL HR & EHS manager in Swindon. “The funding will provide for a new cutting table and four sewing machine chairs for the dressmakers. We are excited to be able to support their endeavours and make an impact for the organization and its clients.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Community Outreach Program evolved in response to needs in the communities where there are operations. AFL is committed to being an exemplary corporate citizen.
