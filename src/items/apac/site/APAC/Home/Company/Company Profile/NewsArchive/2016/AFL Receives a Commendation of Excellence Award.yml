        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a> was presented with a Commendation of Excellence for <a href="/Company/Environment-Health-and-Safety">Safety</a> award presented by the <a href="http://www.scchamber.net/">South Carolina Chamber of Commerce</a>. The Annual Safety Awards recognize companies and their associates who have had a commendable Lost Workday Case Rate during the previous calendar year.<br />
        <br />
        “Safety is one of our core values at AFL and we strive each day to achieve an incident-free workplace,” stated Don Heatherly, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) manager for AFL. “It takes every one of us working together, watching for hazards and communicating potential hazards to receive awards such as these.”<br />
        <br />
        Recipients of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce’s safety award must have a recordable and lost workday injury rate that is below the state average. Throughout 2015, Ridgeview manufacturing associates have worked 4.8M hours without a lost workday incident, USAC associates have worked 750K hours without a lost workday incident, and Hidden Lake manufacturing associates have worked 280K hours without a lost workday incident.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s <a href="/Company/Environment-Health-and-Safety">EHS program</a> is committed to providing a safe work environment for all its associates. Policies and procedures are audited annually to expose areas that need improvement, and every associate must complete annual EHS training courses.<br />
