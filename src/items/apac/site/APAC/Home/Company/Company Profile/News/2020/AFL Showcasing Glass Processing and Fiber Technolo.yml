        AFL’s new <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=010AB67BEF3546D9A559C6D3A2BA3DAF&_z=z">LZM-120A+ LAZERMaster™ Splicing System</a> is a splicing, glass processing system and fiber ablation machine that uses a CO2 laser heat sources to perform splicing, tapering, lensing ablation and other glass shaping operations with glass diameters up to 2.3 mm. The splicing system can splice on endcaps and create ablated cladding mode stripping in one process. Demonstrations will be provided throughout both shows.<br />
        <br />
        The new 500°C Metal-Coated <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5AB6A30E51E6470DADAF45066D58C314&_z=z">Optical Fibers</a> will also be showcased. The VHT500 single-mode and VHT5000 multimode fibers feature advanced glass chemistries for improved performance in hydrogen-rich environments, and excellent optical performance in permanent, long-term exposure to temperatures up to 500°C.<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F151ABBB387443BCB4D123DEDBDDCEA3&_z=z">Fujikura CT-105 LDF Cleaver</a> cleaves fibers up to 1,250 μm and has the ability to provide both flat and angled cleaves using an automatic clamping system with programmable force. The color LCD shows cleaving progress and recommended insert size depending on fiber coating and cladding diameter, and the USB port allows for saving and storing cleaving programs to a PC or tablet.<br />
        <br />
