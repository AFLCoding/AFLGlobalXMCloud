        <div>Spartanburg, SC –  <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, was among hundreds of companies that received safety performance recognition from the <a href="https://www.scchamber.net/">South Carolina Chamber of Commerce</a> at their annual awards luncheon in Columbia on March 28. Recognition is based on the Lost Time Incident Rate recorded during the 2018 calendar year.<br />
        Five AFL manufacturing locations were recognized for this award. AFL’s newest location in Spartangreen logged nearly 86K hours and AFL’s accessories division logged nearly 425K hours without a lost time work incident in 2018. In July 2018 the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DD697FB3AFEA42B2B976EB9288D04701&_z=z">accessories division</a> reached a milestone <em>5 million</em> safe work hours, representing more than 20 years without a lost time accident.<br />
        <br />
        “Safety is a top priority,” explained Jason Chevallard, senior EHS manager of AFL. “Our associates live this core value every day and are conscientious about the affect their actions have on themselves and others. They are exceptionally cognizant of their surroundings which makes a difference for us.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL has an aggressive injury reduction plan with the ultimate goal to become an injury-free workplace. Historically, AFL’s Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) and Days Away, Restricted and Transferred (DART) Rate is 50 percent or more below published industry averages.<br />
