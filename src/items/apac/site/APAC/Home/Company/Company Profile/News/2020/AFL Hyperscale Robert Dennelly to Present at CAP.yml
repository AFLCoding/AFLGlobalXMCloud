        <div>Kent, Washington and Spartanburg, SC – January 27, 2020 – <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=3ACE1DA2BD41439D95F451A80754116B&_z=z">AFL Hyperscale</a>, an international manufacturer of data center cabling and connectivity, will be attending <a href="https://www.capremedia.com/events/capres-2020-data-center-cloud-infrastructure-forecast-east">CAPRE’s 2020 Digital Infrastructure Industry Forecast</a> in Dulles, Virginia on January 30. Taking place in the largest data center market in the world, the event comprises a full day of leading content by industry experts and convenes the Mid-Atlantic region including Maryland, Delaware, District of Columbia, Pennsylvania and Virginia.<br />
        <br />
        Robert Dennelly, director of product line management and engineering with AFL Hyperscale, will moderate a panel discussion on what the year ahead has in store for the edge. Titled “The Year of the Edge: Will There Be Explosive Growth in the Nascent Market?”, panel experts will weigh in on whether edge computing will be pushed to its limits given the number of connected devices growing exponentially.<br />
        <br />
        Attendees will also get an exclusive preview of AFL Hyperscale’s comprehensive assortment of data center solutions including the new traceable patch cord featuring a polarity-reversible LC uniboot connector which allows installers and network engineers to easily locate a cable that needs to be connected, disconnected or moved. Also on display will be the ground-breaking 6,912-fiber Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC) with SpiderWeb Ribbon® (SWR®) technology, a bonded fiber design that significantly reduces cable diameter and weight, and offers a 40 percent reduction on installation time. Seventy-three percent lighter than today’s ribbon cables, SWR is used in ultra-high fiber count indoor and outdoor cable types, and results in lower installation costs plus major improvements in utilization of cable pathways and duct space.<br />

        Panel Discussion<br />
        The Year of the Edge: Will There Be Explosive Growth in the Nascent Market?<br />
        Research firms have predicted that 2020 will be the year edge computing takes off, with the edge cloud market growing by at least 50 percent. Many providers, including public cloud, telecom, colocations, CDNs, are aiming to offer IaaS and PaaS with limited or intermittent connectivity to cloud or data centers. Given the expected increase in connected devices, will edge computing reach its tipping point?<br />
