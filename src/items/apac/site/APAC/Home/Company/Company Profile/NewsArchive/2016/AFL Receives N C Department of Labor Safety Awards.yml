        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a>, a leading service provider and global fiber optics manufacturer, was the recipient of four <a href="/Company/Environment-Health-and-Safety/Safety-Record">safety awards</a> presented on behalf of the North Carolina Department of Labor. Hosted by the Union County Chamber of Commerce, this awards program recognizes private and public firms throughout the state that achieve and maintain good safety records. AFL’s <a href="/Services">network services</a> locations in Monroe and Raleigh, North Carolina both received awards.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s <a href="/Services/What-We-Do/Structured-Cabling">Enterprise</a> and <a href="/Services/What-We-Do/Outside-Plant-Engineering-and-Services">Outside Plant Engineering (OSPE)</a> divisions in Monroe received Silver Awards. The silver award criteria include lost workday cases but not restricted work activity. Applicants must attain a rate for cases with days away from work (CDAW) that is at least 50 percent below the industry rate.<br />
         <br />
        For the seventh year in a row, AFL’s Enterprise division in Raleigh received the Gold Award, given to companies whose rate of days away from work, job transfer or restriction (DART) were at least 50 percent below the industry average. Additionally, AFL’s OSPE division in Raleigh received the same award for the first time.<br />
         <br />
        “AFL is honored to receive the awards from the NC Department of Labor for our safety performance in 2015,” commented Seneca Mullins, executive director for AFL’s enterprise services. “<a href="/Company/Environment-Health-and-Safety">Safety</a> is our number one priority, and we are proud to have completed another campaign worthy of recognition at the state level. We were humbled to be recognized among so many industry leading companies and encouraged to see the commitment to safety in the workplace from our peers.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s <a href="/Company/Environment-Health-and-Safety">environment, health and safety program</a> is one of AFL’s core values. Highlights of the program include providing a safe work environment for all associates; regularly auditing operations to ensure conformance to policies; establishing global safety, health and environmental processes based on regulatory requirements and recognized best practices; and a culture that focuses on continuous improvement.<br />
