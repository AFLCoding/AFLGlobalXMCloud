As part of AFL’s “Volunteers Choose” program, AFL associates that participated in volunteer programs during the previous year voted for a nonprofit organization to receive this annual gift which recognizes volunteer efforts.<br />

They are the backbone of our efforts, reaching out into our community to help those in need,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Not only does this grant celebrate their passion for giving back, but it also provides support to organizations that impact Upstate South Carolina.”<br />
