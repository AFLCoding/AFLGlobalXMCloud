        Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – Ten volunteers from <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, a leading global fiber optics manufacturer, participated in <a href="http://www.graniteuw.org/">Granite United Way’s</a> annual Day of Caring Sept. 19. Five nonprofit organizations received assistance that day from AFL associates including CornerBridge, the Laconia Conservation Commission, Pemi Youth Center, the Salvation Army and Taylor Community.<br />
         <br />
        Volunteers spent the entire day painting, landscaping, organizing and cleaning for organizations. Known as an <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/ACT-Project.aspx">ACT</a> (AFL Community Team), this service was combined with a $3,000 grant for Granite United Way and made possible by <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">AFL’s Community Outreach Program.</a><br />
         <br />
        “By volunteering, not only do we provide a service and learn more about a local nonprofit organization, but we are also able to give back financially to our community,” stated Kim Huckaby, community relations coordinator for AFL in Belmont, New Hampshire. “It’s a win-win!”<br />
         <br />
        Each United Way region in New Hampshire and Vermont participated in the 2014 Day of Caring over a two week timeframe. Over 1200 volunteers participated throughout both states.<br />
        AFL’s Community Outreach Program consists of grants, ACT (AFL Community Team) projects, sponsorships, Take Root (a program to provide trees to communities), disaster relief and more.
