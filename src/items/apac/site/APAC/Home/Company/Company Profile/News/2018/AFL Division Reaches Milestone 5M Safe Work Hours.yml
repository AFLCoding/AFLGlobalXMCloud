        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>’s accessories division reached a record-breaking milestone of 5,000,000 safe work hours, representing more than 20 years without a lost time accident. The “machine shop” environment focuses on the fabrication and assembly of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DD697FB3AFEA42B2B976EB9288D04701&_z=z">aluminum, steel and bronze parts</a> for the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=30EF9D4A179A450CA2319155D6AB87D3&_z=z">electrical utility</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AA1D5882FBA34AAA87AC605FCEF3CA5E&_z=z">rail transit</a> markets. Accessories associates use hand tooling and CNC machinery extensively to create these heavy parts, exposing them to hand injuries every day.<br />
        <br />
        “This is a milestone testament to the hard work and dedication of our associates to work safely, and AFL’s commitment to our core values through training and investment in creating a safe work environment” commented Eric Borowicz, General Manager for AFL’s accessories division.<br />
        <br />
        Safe work hours equates to the cumulative number of work hours in the facility since the last event which resulted in an associate missing a day of work as a result of a workplace accident.<br />
        <br />
        “Given the type of industrial business this division operates in, this is an exceptional accomplishment and a great testament to our workforce,” explained <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1E43BA16D72E497492E487E841506223&_z=z">Jody Gallagher</a>, president and CEO of AFL.<br />
        <br />
