        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="/">AFL</a> is expanding its <a href="/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant/Connectors-and-Accessories/Field-Installable-Connectors/FAST-Connectors_(1)">FAST Connector</a> portfolio to include two new SC/APC connectors to address applications that require an SC/APC interface or need enhanced return loss.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s FAST Connectors are pre-polished, field-installable connectors that eliminate the need for hand polishing in the field. They feature a pre-stubbed, factory-polished ferrule and precision mechanical alignment that ensures low loss termination for either single-mode or multimode fibers. These connectors are compatible with 250 µm and 900 µm fibers as well as 900 µm, 2 mm and 3 mm cordage. All primary fibers are supported and each connector is color-coded for better identification.<br />
        <br />
        Included with the FAST Connector is an innovative translucent wedge that enables the use of a VFI to provide a “pass/fail” signal when physical contact is achieved. In addition, each connector comes with a factory-installed wedge clip that secures a wedge clamp in an open position until a fiber is inserted. Once inserted, the wedge clip is removed and secures the fiber into the fiber channel aligning it with the pre-polished fiber stub contained within.<br />
