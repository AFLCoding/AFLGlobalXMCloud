        Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /">AFL</a>, a global manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, presented <a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a> with a record-breaking $208,000 for its annual United Way Campaign. The donation was made possible by AFL associates as well as AFL’s <a href=" /Company/Community ">Community Outreach Program</a> which supplemented contributions from associates. The donation exceeded the previous year’s by 15 percent. <br />
        <br />
        The campaign theme stemmed from the Star Wars saga, using the tagline, “Make a Difference, You Can.” And make a difference they did. AFL set a company record with an increase in donors by 13 percent and an increase in employee donations by 16 percent over 2015.<br />
        <br />
        “The key to our campaign is making sure that associates understand the impact United Way has in our community and with local nonprofit organizations,” commented Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “We invite these organizations to be a part of our campaign, talk with our associates and make that connection. It helps them understand what the need is and why it’s needed.”<br />
        <br />
        The annual two-week United Way Campaign kicked off with meetings that provided an opportunity for every AFL associate to learn more about United Way’s impact. Agency representatives attended and spoke with AFL associates about their organization and how United Way effects them. Additionally, AFL showcased a video in which associates were interviewed and discussed what United Way means to them.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Test & Inspection division and The Light Brigade® also participated in this year’s United Way campaign. The Test & Inspection division donated $9,000, a 5 percent increase over the previous year and The Light Brigade donated $5,000, a 25 percent increase from the previous year. In total, AFL donated $222,000 to United Way in four states.<br />
