        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> announced today it successfully settled its lawsuit against SurplusEQ.com, Inc., including a permanent injunction against SurplusEQ.com, Inc. issued by the United States District Court. In the suit, AFL contended that SurplusEQ.com, Inc. sold <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing.aspx">Fujikura fusion splicers</a> that were modified from their original design; thus, providing splicers that were materially different, causing confusion to customers. The court concluded:  “A permanent injunction serves the public interest in that it will prevent the confusion that results from the marketing and sale of unauthorized Fujikura fusion splicers that are materially different from those authorized for sale in the U.S., and will prevent the distribution of Fujikura fusion splicers bearing modified software that may cause failures or other defects in the operation of the splicers. Such protection is the central goal of the Lanham (Trademark) Act.”<br />
        <br />
        “AFL is pleased with the outcome of this lawsuit and the positive message for our customers who use Fujikura fusion splicers and rely on them to conduct business on a daily basis,” commented Steve Althoff, executive vice president of AFL’s equipment division. “Fujikura fusion splicers are known for their exceptional performance and high quality, and when customers purchase this brand, they expect to get a product that is the same product that was shipped from Fujikura’s manufacturing plant. Unfortunately, this was not happening. As the exclusive provider of Fujikura fusion splicers in North America, AFL will continue to protect both Fujikura’s and our customer’s interests to the fullest extent.”<br />
        <br />
        A court-approved permanent injunction has been served on SurplusEQ.com, Inc. and its owner, Daniel Parsons. The judgment prohibits SurplusEQ.com, Inc. and Daniel Parsons from selling any new Fujikura fusion splicers, and it prohibits SurplusEQ.com, Inc. and Daniel Parsons from selling any new Fujikura fusion splicers that are not properly licensed and verified for the North American territory. Additionally, SurplusEQ.com, Inc. agreed to pay AFL a significant financial sum to compensate AFL.<br />
        <br />
        AFL is wholly-owned by Fujikura Ltd., the world leader in fusion splicing technology. AFL has the exclusive right to distribute Fujikura fusion splicers in all countries comprising the North America continent.<br />
