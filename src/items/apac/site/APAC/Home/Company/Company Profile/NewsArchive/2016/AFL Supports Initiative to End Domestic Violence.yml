        Monroe, NC and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a> awarded a $2,000 grant to <a href="http://www.turntoday.net/">Turning Point</a>, an organization whose mission is to end domestic abuse, sexual assault and child abuse through providing safe shelter, advocacy, prevention and social change. Made possible by AFL’s <a href="/Company/Community">Community Outreach Program</a>, the funding will be used for shelter expenses and services that provide homeless victims of domestic violence with safe shelter, transportation, counseling and education, children’s programming and client financial assistance.<br />
        <br />
        “Unfortunately, the need for shelter and program services is constant,” commented Seneca Mullins, executive director of AFL’s enterprise services division. “Providing a safe environment as well as counseling for women and children is critical to breaking the cycle of abuse. Turning Point offers this and more.”<br />
        <br />
        Turning Point is a 42 bed, state-of-the-art facility and is the only services provider for domestic violence, sexual assault, child sexual assault and child abuse program and the only domestic violence shelter in Union County. Most clients are females between the ages of 25 – 34 with one to two children.<br />
         <br />
        Turning Point offers many shelter program services for their victims. These services include a 24/7 hotline, transportation coordinated with Monroe Law Enforcement Center and the Union Count Sheriff’s Department, safe shelter for victims and their children, case management, legal advocacy, individual or group women’s counseling and programs targeted toward early childhood and prevention.<br />
        <br />
