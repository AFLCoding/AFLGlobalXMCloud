        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and hardware, earned three <a href="https://myscma.com/">South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance</a> (SCMA) Plant Safety Awards for manufacturing locations in Spartanburg, South Carolina. AFL’s accessories facility reached more than 6,000,000 hours without a Lost Time Accident. The facility at Hillside Enterprise Park continued its record of zero recordable injuries. And finally, AFL’s Howell Road facility continued its record of zero recordables since it opened two years ago.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Facilities with a low rate of incidents resulting in lost workdays, job transfers or restrictions below statewide manufacturing averages for their NAICS code were nominated and earned the award. The facilities receiving this award manufacture <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E545E2A90D414F31BDD0BA9B8ED27FD0&_z=z">fiber optic cable</a><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DD697FB3AFEA42B2B976EB9288D04701&_z=z">, accessories</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=55E85DE502FD4DF7A029245253934A91&_z=z">fusion splicers</a> and operate in highly industrial environments.<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DD697FB3AFEA42B2B976EB9288D04701&_z=z"><br />
        </a>
        <br />
        “Receiving these awards is a significant accomplishment,” explained Geoff VanderVeen, EHS Director for AFL. “It exemplifies the discernment of our associates who are keenly aware of risks associated with manufacturing operations and taking proper precautions to ensure their safety and the safety of others.”<br />
