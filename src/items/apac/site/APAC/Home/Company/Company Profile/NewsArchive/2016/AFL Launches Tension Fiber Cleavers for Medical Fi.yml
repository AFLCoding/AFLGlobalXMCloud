        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> is introducing the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Cleavers/CT-104-Fiber-Cleaver.aspx">Fujikura CT-104 tension cleaver</a> designed for fibers with a cladding diameter of 80 to 600 µm. Developed to address the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Markets/Industries/Medical.aspx">medical</a> and <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Markets/Industries/Fiber-Optic-Component-and-Equipment-Mfg.aspx">fiber laser</a> markets, the CT-104 fiber cleavers offer superior tension cleaving performance beyond other conventional cleavers. The cleavers incorporate a manual clamping system that allows for a quicker cleaving process than what is typical with automated clamping systems.<br />
        <br />
        “The new cleaver provides a fiber cleaving solution that fits between the Fujikura CT-101 and CT-105 cleavers, addressing those applications where speed and performance are key to productivity,” commented Brad Hendrix, global specialty market manager for AFL/Fujikura. “We believe that the market led us to a product that addresses larger cladding diameters at a price point that we believe customers will appreciate.”<br />
        <br />
        The CT-104 tension cleaver is equipped with a new motorized diamond blade assembly. The tension is easily adjusted to meet the precise requirements for all fiber diameters in this range. Additionally, the CT-104 features a large screen as well as the same user interface as our CT-105 and CT-106 cleavers.<br />
        <br />
        Fujikura is well-known around the world for providing the industry standard in <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing.aspx">fusion splicing</a>.
