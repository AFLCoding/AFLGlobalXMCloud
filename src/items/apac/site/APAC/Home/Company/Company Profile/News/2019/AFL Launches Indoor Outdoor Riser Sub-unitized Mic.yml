        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, is adding a new fiber optic cable to its current line-up of MicroCore cable products. The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8DAAD57751AC47FD81A93186D0BF75C4&_z=z">Indoor/Outdoor Riser Sub-unitized MicroCore</a> is a high fiber count cable, ideal for indoor and indoor/outdoor applications.<a>
        “Indoor/Outdoor MicroCore is a great solution for inter-campus data center applications where transitioning between buildings is required,” explained Michael Houck, product manager for AFL’s Inside Plant Cable product line. “Indoor/Outdoor MicroCore utilizes constructions that allow for direct MTP/MPO terminations. Additionally, it is also available with AFL’s patented </a>SpiderWeb Ribbon® SWR® Technology which allows use of AFL field installable splice on <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B216F09D2A9B453583CEF11753CEA116&_z=z">FUSEConnect® Ribbon Connectors</a>.”<br />
        <br />
        The Indoor/Outdoor MicroCore cable consists of water-blocked subunits helically stranded to provide sub-unitized cables ranging from 24 to 288 fiber counts. The water-blocked subunits help ensure that any damage to the cable is restricted to a repairable length of several meters. The outer jacket is moisture-resistant, fungus-resistant and UV-resistant for outdoor applications. With a riser rating, the Indoor/Outdoor MicroCore can be used in riser, general inside plant and limited outside plant applications.<br />
