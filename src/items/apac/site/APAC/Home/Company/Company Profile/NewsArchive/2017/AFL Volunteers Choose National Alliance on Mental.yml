Part of AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=54B66AA7D20E440A829E3731F31C91D4&_z=z">Volunteers Choose</a> program, AFL volunteers had the opportunity to vote on an organization of their choice to receive this special grant. NAMI of Greater Lowell received the majority of the votes.<br />
        <br />
        NAMI of Greater Lowell is a chapter of the national organization that seeks to raise awareness about mental illness and help those navigating the mental health system. President Dick Edgar describes himself and others in the organization as both caregivers of family members with mental illness and concerned citizens.<br />
        <br />
        Elaine Dean, treasurer of NAMI of Greater Lowell, continued, “There is a stigma tied to mental illness but NAMI is bettering lives for millions of Americans, providing a voice through educating, advocating, listening and leading. We rely on contributions such as these to support the work we are doing and we are grateful.”<br />
