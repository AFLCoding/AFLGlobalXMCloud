        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a> is launching a <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Substation-Accessories/Compounds/HiTemp-AFL-Universal-Compound-%28HiTUC%29.aspx">High Temperature Universal Compound (HiTUC)</a> that can be used as a filler compound on <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/HiTemp-Accessories.aspx">high-temp compression accessories</a> and pad-to-pad connections. Designed to withstand the increased operating temperatures of high temperature/low sag conductors, HiTUC is ideal for dead ends, joints, terminals, tee taps and jumper connectors.<br />
        <br />
        Key features include:
        <ul style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; list-style-image: url('https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/bulletRound.aspx');">
            <li>Low electrical resistance – containing extremely hard metallic particles, metal-to-metal contact points are formed for low contact resistance.</li>
            <li>Wide temperature tolerance – workable at low temperatures of -40°C (-40°F) and extremely high temperatures of 250°C (482°F) without dripping.</li>
            <li>Improved current flow – by creating an irregular surface, conductivity is improved with more metal-to-metal connections. The grit acts as a wire brush and creates a low resistance connection in bolted pads of dead ends, terminals and tee taps.</li>
            <li>Moisture resistance – during compression, the compound is forced between conductor strands and seals out harmful effects of contaminates, water and salt.</li>
        </ul>
        “HiTUC’s proven performance in extreme temperatures makes it a superior filler compound,” said Gary Harter, commercial manager for AFL’s conductor accessories division. “The compound reduces electrical resistance and improves current flow.”<br />
        <br />
        With a three-year shelf life, HiTUC fits into a standard caulking gun and features a sight gauge along the length of the tube to allow users to check the remaining amount.<br />
        <br />
