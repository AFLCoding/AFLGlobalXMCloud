        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> is launching its newest cables in the Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC) family—non-armored and armored, riser-rated <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=032F7EDFDA024752B786645EF0B49ED1&_z=z">Flame-Retardant Wrapping Tube Cable with SpiderWeb® Ribbon</a> (FR-WTC-SWR). The FR-WTC-SWR product is a high-density fiber optic ribbon cable intended for inside plant and certain indoor/outdoor network applications where a NFPA NEC riser rating is required. Using SpiderWeb Ribbon (SWR®) technology, the new cable can be used within buildings and, because of the core water-blocking feature, can also be routed between buildings within duct banks or covered pathways.<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/AFL_FR_WTC_PR.aspx" target="_blank"></a><br />
        <br />
        “The FR-WTC-SWR product expands AFL ribbon cables into the campus and data center structured cabling spaces where demand is growing for high fiber count and high density optical circuits that can be routed within building structures,” explained Stephen Martin, product manager for AFL’s cable division. “With this new addition to the Wrapping Tube Cable ribbon product line, AFL continues to provide ground-breaking, innovative cabling solutions that yield improved cost-savings and infrastructure optimization opportunities for the rapidly expanding optical backbone and metro-loop infrastructure market.”<br />
        <br />
        <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=700FA7F356564DF8AA34C82971BFE193&_z=z">SpiderWeb Ribbon</a> is an intermittently-bonded fiber design that conforms to the Flame Retardant Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC) packaging technology, making it ideal for ultra-high density applications. Using SpiderWeb Ribbon technology reduces the size of the cable while the FR-WTC design optimizes the fiber packing density making <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=032F7EDFDA024752B786645EF0B49ED1&_z=z">FR-WTC-SWR</a> cables the smallest ribbon cables with the lowest weight in the industry. Because of the smaller diameter, more optical fibers can be placed into crowded OSP pathways or in-building cable trays. The cable design also includes a gel-free water-blocking system that greatly facilitates fiber access and termination.<br />
        <br />
        The FR-WTC-SWR product set is available in low smoke zero halogen (LSZH), non-armored (288F up to 1,728F) and FR-PVC double-jacket single-armored (288-F up to 864F) constructions. The cable is ideal for inter-building connections, data center, access provider metro rings, service provider FTTx, campus LAN and more.<br />
        <br />
        AFL will be showcasing this cable at <a href="https://www.bicsi.org/winter/2018/">BICSI Winter</a> in Orlando, February 4–8, at booth #329. For additional information on this product and additional AFL products, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
