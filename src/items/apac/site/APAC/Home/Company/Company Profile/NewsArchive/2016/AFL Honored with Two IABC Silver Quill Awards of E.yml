        <span>Spartanburg, SC – </span><a href=" /">AFL</a><span>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, received </span><span>two awards at the 2016 International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) Southern Region conference. AFL’s Marketing Communications Department received two </span><a href="http://iabcsouthern.com/silverquill/">Silver Quill Awards of Excellence</a><span>, the highest ranking award, for Communication Management in the divisions of Marketing Advertising for its </span><a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing ">fusion splicer</a><span> ad campaign and Brand Communication and Employee Engagement for its 2016 </span><a href=" /Company/Community/United-Way ">United Way</a><span> campaign.</span><br />
        <br />
        <span>Prompted by a new, low-cost competitor in the industry that was making false claims, AFL’s </span><a href=" /Products/Fusion-Splicing ">fusion splicer</a><span> ad campaign comprised two different ads. In the “fish” ad, the fisherman’s tale was used as an example of not believing everything you hear and issued a challenge to readers to request a demonstration and decide for themselves. In the “oops” ad, attention was drawn to another false claim about dropping a fusion splicer. Used in rough environments, fusion splicers can be dropped yet will still operate. In this ad, another challenge was issued for readers to schedule a demo where they can drop it and see for themselves.</span><br />
        <span></span><br />
        <span>Both ads performed exceptionally well, exceeding statistics generated from other product ads that ran earlier in the year. More than 40 requests for demonstrations were received via this campaign. Several online banner ads tripled engagement as compared to former product banner ads. Social media interaction also increased substantially.</span><br />
        <span></span><br />
        <span>AFL’s annual </span><a href=" /Company/Community/United-Way ">United Way</a><span> campaign is a five-month endeavor that is implemented within a two-week timeframe. The campaign begins by brainstorming a theme for the campaign—this year’s theme was based on the recently released Star Wars movie. The Marketing Communication Department created artwork used in email blasts, posters and a video which consisted of interviews with associates who support United Way as well as B-roll footage from a local nonprofit. Several events were planned onsite to educate and engage associates. The results of these efforts was a 2016 campaign that netted $208,000 for United Way, a 15 percent increase over 2015, a 15 percent increase in the number of donors and 16 percent increase in employee donations.</span><br />
        <br />
