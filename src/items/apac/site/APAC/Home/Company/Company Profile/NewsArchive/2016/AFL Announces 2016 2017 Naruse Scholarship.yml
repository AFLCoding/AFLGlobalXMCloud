        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a> awarded the 2016-2017 <a href="/Company/Community/Community-Initiatives">Naruse Academic Scholarship</a> to two individuals this year. Katherine Featherstone, daughter of Richard Featherstone, director of manufacturing growth and capital projects for AFL, and Jon Latimer, son of Brian Latimer, services field technician for AFL in Canada, have both shown exemplary academic success and <a href="/Company/Community">community</a> involvement.<br />
        <br />
        Katherine Featherstone is graduating as an AP Scholar with distinction from J.L. Mann. Having served as co-captain of the varsity tennis team, senior class treasurer and as President of Service for J.L. Mann’s National Honor Society, Katherine is also active with Mann Nation (J.L. Mann’s Spirit Club), Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Forensics Club. Alongside these activities, Katherine teaches Sunday school, participates with Youth Leadership Greenville and Palmetto Girls State, a one-week leadership and citizenship training program.<br />
        <br />
        As a member of the Teacher Cadet Program sponsored by Clemson University, Katherine learned the value of education as she watched children flourish with newfound knowledge. She became increasingly interested in the science behind driving this behavior which led her to apply to Clemson University to pursue a degree in sociology.<br />
        <br />
        Jon Latimer is graduating from Medicine Hat High School in Canada. Jon is an avid volunteer at the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), City of Medicine Hat Litter Blitz and Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup. While attending high school, he was a dedicated member of the school band, playing the trombone, performing in several concerts each year. Since early childhood, Jon has aspired to become a teacher and is following his aspirations by pursuing a degree in education at Medicine Hat College with plans to continue his education at a post-secondary institution.<br />
        <br />
        Each year, AFL awards a four-year scholarship to the son or daughter of a North American-based AFL associate entering a college or university. The scholarship was named in memory of Toshihide Naruse, Managing Director of Fujikura, AFL’s parent company. Mr. Naruse’s contributions to AFL were significant, and because of his personal interest in higher education, AFL continues to honor his memory.<br />
