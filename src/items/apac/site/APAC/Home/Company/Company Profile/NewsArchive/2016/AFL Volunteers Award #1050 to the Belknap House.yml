        Laconia, NH and Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /Home ">AFL</a> associates presented a $1,050 <a href=" /Company/Community/Community-Initiatives ">Volunteers Choose</a> grant to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/l2belknaphouse/home">Belknap House</a>. Located in Laconia, NH the Belknap House is a six bedroom homeless shelter that extends help to families in need. Scheduled to open in October 2016, the organization will also provide education opportunities and resources to empower families to become self-sufficient.<br />
        <br />
        Made possible by AFL’s Community Outreach Program, the Volunteers Choose award is directed by AFL associates who have volunteered for a company-sponsored outreach program in the previous year. Each volunteer casts a vote for an organization of their choice to receive the annual grant.<br />
        <br />
        “Our associates are dedicated to serving in our community in many ways,” commented Linda Heney, customer service supervisor for AFL in New Hampshire. “This grant is a great way to thank them for their continued support and give back even more.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL associates from the Belmont, NH office contributed to renovations at the home. Assisting with interior and exterior work, associates installed carpet, demolished walls, removed doors, painted and performed outdoor cleanup to the home.<br />
        <br />
