        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable and connectivity, awarded a $10,000 grant to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.spartanburgymca.org/">YMCA of Greater Spartanburg</a>&nbsp;for its annual scholarship fund which serves children and families in the Spartanburg region. Made possible by AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&amp;_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>, the grant supports the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spartanburgymca.org/branch/middle-tyger">Middle Tyger YMCA</a>&rsquo;s Childcare program and allows families to receive financial assistance.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        The YMCA Childcare program serves children year-round. Components of the program include Summer Day Camp, an Afterschool Program, and a free drop-in care program for children ages six weeks to 12 years old. The primary focus during the school year is to help students improve their academic standing. The YMCA offers tutoring, provides help with homework, and assists with school projects before children participate in recreational opportunities available.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &ldquo;The Afterschool Program provides a structured, safe and nurturing environment where children complete their homework daily and receive academic enrichment in literacy, STEM and humanities, and learn character values,&rdquo; explained Deidre Taber, Branch Executive Director. &ldquo;Children receive a healthy snack and participate daily in physical activities. Approximately 30 percent of our children in our afterschool program receive financial assistance. We&rsquo;re thankful to AFL for continuing to support the work we do.&rdquo;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spartanburgymca.org/">YMCA of Greater Spartanburg</a>&nbsp;has served Spartanburg County since 1869. For the past 60+ years, it has been a leading childcare agency, having served more children annually than any other social service organization. It has dedicated various resources to serve the surrounding community.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        AFL has an extensive&nbsp;Community Outreach Program&nbsp;that provides grants, sponsorships, volunteer projects, disaster relief and more. For additional information on AFL and its community initiatives, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
