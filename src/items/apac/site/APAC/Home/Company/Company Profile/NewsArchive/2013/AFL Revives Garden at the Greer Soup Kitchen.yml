        Spartanburg, SC – Aromas of basil and mulch spread across the <a href="http://www.greersoupkitchen.com/">Greer Soup Kitchen</a>’s property as <a href="/">AFL</a> associates pulled weeds, spread mulch, sowed seeds and planted herbs in the kitchen’s backyard garden. To further support the nonprofit organization, AFL volunteers presented a $1,500 grant made possible by AFL’s <a href="/Company/Community">Community Outreach Program</a>.<br />
        <br />
        Founded in 1990, the Greer Soup Kitchen was developed to help reduce hunger in the Greer community. In its first year, the Greer Soup Kitchen served over 6,000 meals, with over 1,000 individuals, businesses, churches and civic organizations volunteering or donating to the organization. Aside from two part-time employees, the Greer Soup Kitchen is fully-operated by volunteers and is open every day of the year.<br />
        <br />
        The garden, which was constructed eight years ago, is usually maintained by various volunteer groups each planting season. With the help of ACT (AFL Community Team) volunteers, the garden was refurbished and, in time, will provide the kitchen with fresh vegetables and herbs year-round.<br />
        <br />
        After five hours of hard work, AFL associates were able to transform the overgrown garden into a utopia for vegetables and herbs. Sweet potatoes, onions, peppers, cucumbers, cabbage, squash, basil, parsley, thyme and much more were planted in over 20 raised garden beds. New irrigation systems were also installed and the entire area was cleared of debris and weeds.<br />
        <br />
        “The Greer Soup Kitchen has a huge impact on our community. It provides a hot meal to those who need it most while bringing community members together under a great cause,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Our volunteers were excited about working in the garden and having the opportunity to support the organization and their endeavors. In fact, some of our volunteers intend to return to continue cultivating the garden.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s ACT program encourages a team of AFL volunteers, along with family and friends, to reach out to nonprofit organizations in our community and serve alongside the staff and clients.
