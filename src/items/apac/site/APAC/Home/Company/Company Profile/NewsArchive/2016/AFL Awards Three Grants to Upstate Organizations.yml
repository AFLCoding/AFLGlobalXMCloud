        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://qa.aflglobalsc/">AFL</a> awarded $27,500 in community outreach grants to three local nonprofit organizations including the Hope Center for Children, Middle Tyger Community Center and Habitat for Humanity of Greenville. Made possible by <a href="/Company/Community">AFL’s Community Outreach Program</a>, the grants support education and social programs targeted toward helping families and individuals.<br />
        <br />
        AFL awarded the <a href="http://www.middletyger.org/">Middle Tyger Community Center</a> (MTCC) a $15,000 grant in support of its Family Counseling Center. This grant will provide funding and resources toward mental health programs and will allow the Center to provide counseling sessions to low-income individuals and families in the area that are in need of therapeutic intervention but do not have access to affordable mental health services in the Spartanburg community. MTCC provides holistic resources to enhance and support the lives of people in Spartanburg County with programs that focus on improving the health, education and financial stability.<br />
         <br />
        <a href="https://www.habitatgreenville.org/">Habitat for Humanity of Greenville</a> was the recipient of a $7,500 grant for its More Than Houses project. Not only will this project build new, single-family homes for Habitat families, it will also provide a systematic approach to eradicating the barriers that prevent low-income families from achieving a stable and upwardly mobile lifestyle. The project will support neighborhood revitalization in a community off White Horse Road in Greenville and is an intentional, organized effort to serve military veterans through home rehabilitation and neighborhood revitalization.<br />
        <br />
        The <a href="http://www.hopecfc.org/">Hope Center for Children</a> was the recipient of a $5,000 grant for its transitional living program which serves youth aged 16 to 22 years old who are aging out of foster care, are homeless or have no safe place to live as they move into adulthood. The program provides temporary shelter as a youth gains skills needed to live independently and as they finish school or seek a full-time job. The program also serves pregnant teens and teen moms by teaching parenting skills and promoting a healthy mother-child bond.<br />
