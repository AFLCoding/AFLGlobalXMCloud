        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, a leading global fiber optics manufacturer and service provider, presented $3,000 to the <a href="http://www.unionshelter.org/">Union County Community Shelter</a> (UCCS) in support of its emergency sheltering and rapid rehousing initiative. The <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/Grants.aspx">grant</a> will provide rapid rehousing support to six households, helping to end homelessness for six families or individuals. Costs supported include those associated with moving into a home including first month’s rent, utilities and deposits.</div>
        <div>“Many of the homeless are "situationally homeless" meaning that a financial, health or family crisis caused their former home's eviction or foreclosure,” stated Kathy Bragg, executive director of UCCS. “Although they may have jobs or disability/retirement income to sustain a modest monthly rent, the large costs associated with moving into a new home are difficult to save on poverty level wages.”<br />
        <br />
        The Community Shelter case manager and housing coordinator work within a client's budget to determine what portion of the move in costs the client can and should pay and what part the Community Shelter will pay. Their budget will also contain the necessary strategies for the client to self-maintain housing costs long term before move in assistance is provided.<br />
        <br />
        “Homelessness can be a vicious cycle,” commented Seneca Mullins, executive director of enterprise services for AFL. “UCCS is making strides to achieve their mission by working with individuals and families to end this cycle and helping them become self-sufficient. We’re excited to support this organization and help them meet their goals.”<br />
        <br />
        UCCS strives to end hunger and homelessness in the community by providing food, emergency shelter and instruction to those individuals and families in need. They promote a pathway to self-sufficiency including income stabilization and permanent housing.<br />
