        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and accessories, provided a $3,600 grant to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hubcityfm.org/">Hub City Farmers Market</a>&nbsp;(HCFM) to support its Urban Teaching Farm. Made possible by AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&amp;_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>, funding from the grant will help aid the summer Youth Farm program by providing program supplies and support for an intern.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;One of the goals of the Urban Teaching Farm program is to prepare youth for future financial stability, to be college and career ready, to understand how to make healthy decisions and grow their own food, and to be inclusive and collaborative in communication with others,&rdquo; explained Jordan Wolfe, executive director of Hub City Farmers Market. &ldquo;This preparation alone hugely benefits the community as it makes for a more productive one.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        HCFM recruits crew members from local high schools in Districts 6 and 7 for an 8-week internship that involves thoughtful farm work and community-led workshops. The Crew Leader is recruited from a local college. Interested crew members and crew leaders go through a two-step interview process that prepares them for future career interviews.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Wolfe continued, &ldquo;Another goal of the program is to empower socially and economically vulnerable youth through sustainable agriculture, rigor, responsibility, and purpose. Crew Members participate in a variety of workshops that include health/wellness, financial literacy, mindfulness, college/career readiness, diversity/equity/inclusion, and more. They are led by the Crew Leader who will gain experience in management, non-profit work, sustainable agriculture, and team building.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        Hub City Farmers Market seeks to increase the supply, access and demand of healthy, local food in Spartanburg through three different avenues&mdash;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hubcityfm.org/farmers-market">Saturday Farmers Market</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hubcityfm.org/mobile-market">Mobile Market</a>, and an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hubcityfm.org/urban-farm">Urban Teaching Farm</a>.<br />
