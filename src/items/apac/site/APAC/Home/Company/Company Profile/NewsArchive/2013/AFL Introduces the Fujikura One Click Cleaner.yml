        Spartanburg, SC and Lowell, MA – <a href="/">AFL</a> has expanded its One-Click Cleaner product line adding the <a href="/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Cleaning/One-Click-Cleaner-MPO ">One-Click Cleaner MPO</a> to its <a href="/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Cleaning ">NOYES® cleaning product line</a>. Ideal for data center personnel, the revolutionary push-type cleaner simplifies ferrule end-face cleaning on both exposed MPO connectors and MPO connectors in adapters. As with all One-Click Cleaners, the One-Click Cleaner MPO uses the innovative push-to-clean design. The mechanical push action advances the optical grade cleaning tape while effectively and gently cleaning the end-face of the connector.<br />
        <br />
        “Proper cleaning of fiber optic connectors prevents the most common causes of performance degradation, network and component failure, and network down time,” explains Kevin Haddock, product line manager for the AFL NOYES Test and Inspection Division. “The new One-Click Cleaner MPO makes the cleaning of MPO connectors easier than ever“.<br />
