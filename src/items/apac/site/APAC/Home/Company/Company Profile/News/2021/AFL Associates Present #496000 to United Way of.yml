        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and accessories, completed its annual United Way campaign by presenting $496,000 to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a>. The donation was made possible by AFL associates and AFL&rsquo;s matching program which matches all donations up to $100.
        <br />
        &ldquo;I am inspired by the generosity of our associates. At a time when nonprofit organizations are still in dire need of financial support, our associates stepped up and owned the cause,&rdquo; commented Jody Gallagher, CEO and President of AFL. &ldquo;Community Engagement is one of our Core Values. It&rsquo;s embedded in our culture and will forever be a part of who we are.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        The campaign theme, &ldquo;Global Games&mdash;Give for the Gold,&rdquo; coincided with the upcoming Tokyo Games, which is also the headquarters of AFL&rsquo;s parent company, Fujikura Ltd. During the two-week campaign, associates learned more about the need in the community and were given opportunities to consider a donation. AFL realized a seven percent increase in donors over the previous year and 31 percent increase in financial contributions.<br />
        <br />
        &ldquo;AFL is an amazing corporate partner! Their generosity is a reflection of their culture,&rdquo; stated Paige Stephenson, President &amp; CEO of United Way of the Piedmont. &ldquo;We hold up AFL as a model for true corporate partnership. It is a year-round connection where associates are given the opportunity to invest their time and talent, as well as their treasure.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a>&rsquo;s mission is to connect, engage and inspire people to transform the community. By 2030, its goal is to decrease the number of individuals living below self-sufficiency by 11,000. As part of their work in education, financial stability and health, United Way of the Piedmont is committed to ensuring that the programs invested in, and the outcomes generated are equitable.<br />
        <br />
        Locations worldwide conducted campaigns during the month of June, generating $670,000 for AFL communities worldwide. This is a 36 percent increase over 2020 and a 27 percent increase in the number of donors.<br />
        <br />
        AFL has an extensive&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&amp;_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>&nbsp;that provides grants, sponsorships, associate engagement projects, disaster relief and more.
