        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> is introducing a new <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable.aspx">fiber optic cable</a> and <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection.aspx">test equipment</a> technology at the BICSI Fall Conference and Exhibition in Anaheim, California, Sept. 29 – Oct. 1. Both <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Enterprise/Inside-Plant-Cable/Sub-unitized-Premise-MicroCore-3-0.aspx">Sub-unitized Premise MicroCore 3.0</a> and <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Company-Profile/News/2014/AFL-Launches-TruEvent-Technology.aspx">TruEvent™ technology</a> highlight AFL’s newest product introductions this fall.<br />
        <br />
        Sub-unitized Premise MicroCore 3.0 provides greater fiber density in a compact and easy-to-manage 3.0 mm frame. By utilizing a 24-fiber loose tube design, MicroCore 3.0 can house up to 288 fibers while maintaining a flexible form, thereby optimizing space in a new or existing routing infrastructure.<br />
        <br />
        Also new at this year’s show is AFL’s TruEvent Technology, advanced event analysis software used in AFL’s M-series OTDRs that provides a new level of accuracy and reliability in event analysis. This new technology allows the user to confidently determine where losses meet or exceed specifications from data centers to long haul applications.<br />
