        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/default.aspx">AFL</a>, a leading fiber optic cable and accessories manufacturer and provider of services, is celebrating its <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Company-Profile/30th-Anniversary.aspx">30-year anniversary</a> throughout 2014, commemorating this occasion with activities around the world. AFL commenced operations in 1984 in Spartanburg, South Carolina where it manufactured Optical Ground Wire (OPGW), a fiber optic cable used on transmission lines. Through organic growth and acquisitions, AFL has grown to an internationally-recognized company that offers solutions for telecom, broadband, enterprise and electric utility to oil and gas, mining and transportation.<br />
        <br />
        AFL is commemorating its 30 years by extending its reach into communities. Through AFL’s <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>, AFL associates are building a Habitat for Humanity home in Greer. The project will begin March 1 and continue through mid-June and will be completely built by AFL associates, their friends and family.<br />
        <br />
        During the month of April, locations around the world will participate in 30 Days of Service, giving back to their communities by participating in an ACT (AFL Community Team) service project, Take Root tree planting or other outreach initiative. In the fall, associates and their families will enjoy a family fall festival to recognize them for their efforts over the years.<br />
        <br />
        AFL started as a joint venture and in 2005 became wholly owned by Fujikura Ltd. of Japan. AFL’s growth over the past several years is highlighted by acquisitions in Europe and the South Pacific, adding capacity to operations and hiring best-in-class associates.
