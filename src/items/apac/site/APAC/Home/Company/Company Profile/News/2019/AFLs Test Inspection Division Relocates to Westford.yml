        <div>Westford, MA and Spartanburg, SC – June 12, 2019 – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, accessories and equipment, announces that its <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=67697A36EE374C21A1F009672463F0E6&_z=z">Test and Inspection</a> Division expanded and relocated from the Lowell, MA office to Westford, MA, allowing AFL to continue its growth strategy via workforce and technical innovation.
        <br />
        “A strong commitment by the state to the integrated photonics sector has created a vibrant ecosystem and talent pipeline that is critical to our current and future success,” commented Dave LeBlanc, general manager of AFL’s Test & Inspection Division. “This pipeline will help fuel our strategy for continued growth.”<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> acquired Noyes Fiber Systems in 2000, expanding its product base to include test and inspection products and supporting AFL’s vision as a full systems solution provider.<br />
        <br />
        LeBlanc continued, “With exponential growth in the telecommunications industry, the need for technologically-advanced equipment to support this growth is overwhelming. Our people are our greatest asset and we look forward to continual development of talent in our area.”<br />
        <br />
        In addition to the move, AFL has also recently introduced two new innovative fiber optic testing products: the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=20242C1BCD984C08B5684793B2F54606&_z=z">FOCIS Lightning Multi-Fiber Connector Inspection System</a> and the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A1055BC9C33B40258E0F1C3DAC9D2B44&_z=z">FlexScan FS300 Quad Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR)</a>.<br />
        <br />
        The new office is located at 2 Technology Drive, Westford MA 01886. For additional information about AFL, its products and services, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
