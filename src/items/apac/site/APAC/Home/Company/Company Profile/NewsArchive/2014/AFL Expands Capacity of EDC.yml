        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a> increased capacity of its <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Outside-Plant/IDEAA/IDEAA-Exterior-Distribution-Cabinet.aspx">IDEAA® Exterior Distribution Cabinet</a> to provide management of up to 864 fibers for point-to-multipoint, point-to-point and WDM distributions. With the use of IDEAA splitter modules, fiber management, routing and termination is enhanced and deployment costs are lowered. Additionally, the innovative jumper routing allows for increased manageability in customer moves, additions or adjustments as the carrier network scales and changes.<br />
         <br />
        “The IDEAA splitter platform has been well-received by customers across North America and as far as the Middle East,” said William Miller, associate product manager of OSP Connectivity at AFL. “Until now, the IDEAA EDC has been limited to 432 fiber distribution or less. Release of the 864 fiber EDC allows our customers to continue to utilize the feature-rich EDC into more fiber-dense areas of their networks.”<br />
         <br />
        AFL’s IDEAA Exterior Distribution Cabinet provides flexible pad and pole-mounting options to accommodate deployment in convenient locations and its smaller frame is unobtrusive in residential areas. Available in three different sizes, each model of the IDEAA Exterior Distribution Cabinet provides dual-door entry for easier access and fiber/module management.<br />
