        <p>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=110D559FDEA542EA9C1C8A5DF7E70EF9&_z=z">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, is exhibiting at <a href="https://expo.scte.org/">SCTE/ISBE Cable-Tec Expo</a> in Atlanta and featuring the latest technologies in connectivity products, equipment and cable products at booth #831.</p>
        <div>
        AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=870BF0DCE843494FA82A4BB09B9194E4&_z=z">CGM™ Plus</a> is the newest product in the connectivity portfolio and will feature in the booth. A high-density rack-mount panel designed for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) applications, the CGM Plus can hold LGX® and CGM devices interchangeably. Also showcased will be the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1C02FEF0BA5045378E031A27C560D9EB&_z=z">TITAN RTD® Multiport Terminal</a>, a factory terminated OSP fiber terminal designed for quick and easy subscriber connections anywhere in the OSP network when used in conjunction with <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6B7BB7C698E34CFB98ACAB5B01BD0DBF&_z=z">AFL TRIDENT® Hardened Fiber Optic Connectors</a>. The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2EF8C4EA1DB34E40A7BB50EB1BA4111C&_z=z">LightLink LL-580</a> and its smaller counterpart the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=06416D54D8244BD1AE1B9BD4A76356D6&_z=z">LightLink LL-550</a> will also be on display. These optical splicing and distribution enclosures provide for organizing, splicing and interconnecting fibers in broadband, distribution and building entrance applications.
        AFL recently launched two new fusion splicers, the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=750EE63900404AB2B3DDC1AB825DD815&_z=z">Fujikura 41S Core Sensing fusion splicer</a> and the 31S, and will be demonstrating both in the booth. With touchscreen technology and active cladding alignment capability, these fusion splicers greatly reduce the need for rigorous cleaning in typical field conditions. The Fujikura 41S adds more accurate core sensing loss estimation capabilities enabled by Warm Splice Imaging (WSI) and incorporates active cleaver management via Bluetooth® technology.<br />
        <br />
        Test equipment to be demonstrated includes <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-Duel-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-System.aspx">FOCIS Duel</a>, a self-contained twin-ported Bluetooth connected fiber optic connector inspection probe with integrated screen, and <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-WiFi2-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-Syste.aspx">FOCIS WiFi2</a>, an ergonomic Fiber Optic Connector Inspection System that, when paired with an iOS or Android smart device, provides fast and accurate IEC/IPC/AT&T compliant and user-defined pass/fail end-face cleanliness analysis.<br />
        <br />
        For cable products, AFL will feature a host of MicroCore® cables. The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E3EB3C385CF74B19A8E4B4564B608857&_z=z">LM200-Series OSP MicroCore Cable</a> allows for reduced diameter cables and is founded on a design of multi-fiber-set, gel-filled buffer tube construction. The<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2DB2708DDA62475082F47147843A3B25&_z=z"> LMHD-Series OSP MicroCore Cable</a> has a small-size, thick-walled sheath making it highly versatile. And AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=740F36E4074A417CBAB68839104B5517&_z=z">Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC) with SpiderWeb Ribbon (SWR)</a> will also be on display.<br />
