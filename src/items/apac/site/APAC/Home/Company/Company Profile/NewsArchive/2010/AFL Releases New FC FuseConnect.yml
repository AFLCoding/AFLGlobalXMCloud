        Spartanburg, SC – AFL announces the addition of the FC connector to its FuseConnect family. Utilizing a fusion splicer, AFL's FuseConnect consist of just four components, simplifying the field installation process. With a pre-polished ferrule, the termination process eliminates polishing, adhesives and crimping, and minimizes operator error and excess connector scrap. AFL's FuseConnect connectors are also available in SC, LC, and keyed LC.<br />
        <br />
        AFL is also introducing a new LC Duplex Clip designed specifically for AFL's FuseConnect and FAST connectors. AFL's FAST connectors are pre-polished, field installable connectors that also eliminate the need for hand polishing in the field. This connector encompasses a translucent wedge enabling the use of a VFI to provide a pass/fail signal once contact is achieved. FAST connectors are available in SC, ST and LC versions only.<br />
        <br />
        The FC FuseConnect and new LC duplex clip are now available. For additional information on all connectors, visitwww.AFLglobal.com.<br />
