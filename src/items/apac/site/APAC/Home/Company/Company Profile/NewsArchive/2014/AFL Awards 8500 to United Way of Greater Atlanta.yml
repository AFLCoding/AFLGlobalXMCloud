        Norcross, GA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading global manufacturer and provider of services, presented an $8,500 donation to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.unitedwayatlanta.org/about/" target="_blank">United Way of Greater Atlanta</a> made possible by AFL associates and AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>. The donation stems from AFL’s annual United Way campaign, where associates participate in projects and activities geared toward giving back to their local communities.<br />
        <br />
        Over the three-week campaign themed “Let’s Go Crazy and Live United,” associates participated in a number of community events, including filling and decorating over 100 snack bags with healthy foods, which were distributed to children who participate in a variety of United Way programs over the summer.<br />
        <br />
        “This is AFL’s first year partnering with United Way of Greater Atlanta. We welcome the opportunity to work with them and lead a campaign that gives back to our community,” commented Mike Booth, president of AFL’s Network Services Division. “I’m very pleased with the outcome and look forward to partnering with United Way going forward.”<br />
        <br />

Its mission is to engage all segments of the community to drive sustainable change in education, income, health and homelessness while continuing to address urgent and basic human care.<br />
        <br />
