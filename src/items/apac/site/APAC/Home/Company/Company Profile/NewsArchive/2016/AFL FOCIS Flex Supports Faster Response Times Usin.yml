        Duncan, SC and Lyon, France – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.varioptic.com/" target="_blank">Varioptic</a>, a business unit of Parrot Drones SAS, announce that AFL’s award-winning <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-Flex-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-System.aspx">FOCIS Flex connector inspection system</a> utilizes Varioptic’s innovative liquid lens technology. Introduced in 2014, FOCIS Flex was the first auto-focus fiber optic connector inspection system in the industry. The inspection system integrates the Varioptic Arctic Variable Focus <a href="http://www.varioptic.com/technology/liquid-lens-autofocus-af/">Liquid Lens</a> designed for applications requiring fast response time and high optical power.<br />
        <br />
        According to Michael Scholten, senior product marketing manager at AFL, “Varioptic’s liquid lens technology is an important differentiator in AFL’s FOCIS Flex solution. Since FOCIS Flex is battery powered and typically used in field operation, robustness, low power and compact size provide key benefits compared to motor-driven lenses.”<br />
        <br />
        Recently awarded the Platinum Innovator Award by <em>Cabling Installation & Maintenance</em>, the compact, handheld <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-Flex-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-System.aspx">FOCIS Flex</a> provides pass/fail results in seconds, supports independent, untethered operation, transfers results via Bluetooth® to paired OTDRs or Android smart devices, and saves results internally or externally. Uploaded images and pass/fail results may be included in reports prepared using AFL’s Windows®-compatible <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Software/Test-Results-Manager-PC-Analysis-and-Reporting.aspx">TRM® 2.0 Test Results Manager</a> software, shipped with each FOCIS Flex. The solution is mainly used in the telecommunications, broadband and enterprise industries.<br />
        <br />
        “We are pleased to partner with AFL, a long-term established player in the field of fiber optic instruments,” mentions Frederic Laune, director of sales and marketing for Varioptic. “The FOCIS Flex is the first autofocus optical fiber inspection system using our technology. We are proud to enable faster and easier inspections for AFL’s customers.”<br />
