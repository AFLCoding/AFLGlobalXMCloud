        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a> has been awarded five patents for new technologies used in the enhancement of AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Inside-Plant.aspx">Optical Connectivity and Apparatus</a> (OCA) and <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection.aspx">test and inspection</a> products.<br />
        <br />
        The first patent is for an Optical Fiber Expansion Joint which helically bridges the gap between two cable end units within a loose tube fiber optic cable. This apparatus secures the cable’s structural integrity while also preventing micro-bends caused by shrinking of the outer jacket.<br />
        <br />
        The second patent is for a High Fiber Count Package Foam Insert that enhances packaging and securing High Fiber Count (HFC) connector assemblies. The foam insert allows installers to route HFC connector assemblies into ducts, airways and panels without removing the packaging, ensuring the cable’s integrity throughout the installation process.<br />
        <br />
        The next patent is for a Fiber Management Spool that uses an innovative snap on design for installation onto panels which store and control optical fibers, preventing attenuation due to excessive bending. Another patent was received for a High Density Cable Management Bracket which aids in arranging terminating ends of cables by routing them at different distances from the mounting end of the bracket.<br />
        <br />
        Lastly, a patent was received for an Interferometer Adapter Cap which provides a low sensitivity and cost effective solution for attachment of optical flats to portable optical fiber inspection microscopes.<br />
