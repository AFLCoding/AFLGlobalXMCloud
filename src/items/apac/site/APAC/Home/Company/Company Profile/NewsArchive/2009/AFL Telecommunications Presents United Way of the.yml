        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;"><strong>Spartanburg, SC</strong> - On June 11, AFL presented a $60,000 check for its annual United Way campaign to Kathy Dunleavy, President and CEO of United Way of the Piedmont. This year’s contribution is an increase of 45% over the 2008 campaign.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">“With the downturn in the economy, we didn’t set high expectations and were hoping to maintain last year’s giving or give slightly higher,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager of AFL. “But at a time when our community needs us the most, our associates really stepped up to the plate to give back.” Employee giving increased 47% over the 2008 campaign.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">AFL kicked off its campaign with a corporate contribution of $5,000 and two challenges – AFL matched, dollar for dollar, all monies donated over last year’s employee contributions; and teams were set up with various goals to attain, earning associates an additional vacation day. AFL ambassadors were recruited internally to answer questions and talk with other associates about United Way and their mission, as well as encourage associates to donate, making them aware of the different goals. AFL held an Agency Fair in early May where various agencies from both Spartanburg and Greenville where invited set up a display and talk with associates about what they do, what their needs are and how they can help. And lastly, AFL hosted a company carnival where associates competed for prizes and bragging rights with a Rock Star Wii competition, basketball hoops competition, putting green, horseshoes and adult trike races.</p>
        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 0px 0px 15px;">“When we plan our events, we want to accomplish two things – inform associates about United Way and community agencies and generate excitement about what they do that helps our community prosper,” said Sherise Brown, Human Resources Director. “We’re pleased to support United Way each year and we thank our employees for helping to make this year’s campaign a monumental success.”<br />
