        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> is launching the next generation of high performance <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Enterprise/Inside-Plant-Cable/Sub-Unitized-Microcore-2-0.aspx">sub-unitized MicroCore</a> cables. Ideal for high density infrastructures, this cable realizes significant savings in space required for fiber management . The sub-unitized MicroCore 2.0 cable features a small diameter. Enabled by the standards compliant 2.0 mm sub-cables, this product family supports both direct termination and single fiber architectures.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL’s family of fiber optic cable is constructed of the highest quality materials and to exacting industry standards,” commented Doug Baker, commercial manager for AFL’s premise and black jacket cables. “Each sub-cable is independently qualified and is suitable for individual routing within the rack or panel architecture. This enables a flexibility of design and deployment not available in comparable high density designs.  Additionally, this cable family from AFL supports field repair of complex high-density pre-terminated optical trunks when AFL’s full line of field-terminable Fuse-Connect solutions are also specified. ”<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s sub-unitized MicroCore can be used in headend terminations to a fiber backbone, termination of fiber rack systems, multi-floor deployment where select fibers are used at each floor, intra-building backbones and MTP/MPO or MTP to break-out terminations. Available in 12 to 144 fibers, sub-unitized MicroCore 2.0 is compliant to RoHS/REACH directives and NFPA 262 plenum-rated.<br />
