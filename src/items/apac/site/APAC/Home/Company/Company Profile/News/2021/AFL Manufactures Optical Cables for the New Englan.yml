        <div>Melbourne, Victoria and Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading manufacturer of fibre optic cable, equipment and accessories, has manufactured and supplied optical fibre cable to&nbsp;<a href="https://newenglandsolarfarm.com.au/the-project/greenlight/">Green Light Contractors Pty Ltd for the New England Solar Farm</a>.<br />
        The New England Solar Farm is being developed by leading renewable energy developer UPC\AC Renewables Australia across two solar fields near Uralla in the New England region of NSW. The solar farm will be built in two stages, with the first 400MW (AC) stage and the 33/330 kilovolt (kV) substation being installed by Green Light Contractors across the northern section of the site. Once fully constructed, the project is expected to produce 1,800,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of clean, renewable electricity each year; enough to power more than 250,000 typical NSW homes.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        &ldquo;The project utilised AFL&rsquo;s Quad-FRP range of loose tube cables,&rdquo; explained Jeremy Judge, Account Manager for Infrastructure Markets at AFL. &ldquo;This provides a compact, high strength cable, ideal for use in renewables projects such as this. This type of cable is very popular with energy customers across the country.&rdquo;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        The cables for the project were manufactured in AFL&rsquo;s facility in Melbourne, Australia. The ISO9001 and ISO14001 certified facility manufactures a variety of bulk optical fibre cables, predominantly for the Australian market. The supply of the project continues AFL&rsquo;s long-standing involvement in the renewable energy industry and is reflective of AFL&rsquo;s continued commitment to the transition to renewables.<br />
