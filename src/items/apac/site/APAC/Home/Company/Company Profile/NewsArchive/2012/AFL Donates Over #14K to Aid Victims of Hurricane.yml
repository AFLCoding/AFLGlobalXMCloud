        Spartanburg, SC – In light of the devastation from Hurricane Sandy that hit late October 2012, <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> partnered with the <a href="http://www.redcross.org/">American Red Cross</a> to set up an online disaster relief site for monetary donations. Starting with a $5,000 donation made possible by <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">AFL’s Community Outreach Program</a>, associates’ donations were matched, dollar for dollar, to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief fund. Donors raised over $4,000 and with AFL’s match and contribution, the American Red Cross received $14,950 for its disaster relief efforts.<br />
         <br />
        “AFL associates know how to make a difference in the lives of others and they are always so willing to support those in need,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Our efforts will only go so far, but we know that we are part of a much larger initiative to repair the lives of those affected. We know we are making a difference!”<br />
         <br />
        AFL’s Community Outreach program consists of several initiatives—all with the same goal: to make a positive difference in the lives of others. Through grants, employee engagement programs, environmental initiatives and more, AFL imagines communities that are strong and thriving.
