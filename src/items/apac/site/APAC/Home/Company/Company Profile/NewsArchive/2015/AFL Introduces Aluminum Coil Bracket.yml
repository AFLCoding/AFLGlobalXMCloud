        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> introduces an aluminum coil bracket for splice enclosures including its <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Fiber-Optic-Cable-Hardware/OPGW-Hardware/Opti-Guard-Splice-Enclosure.aspx">Opti-Guard™</a> and <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Fiber-Optic-Cable-Hardware/OPGW-Hardware/SB01-Splice-Enclosure-and-Accessories.aspx">SB01</a> products. The aluminum coil bracket is much lighter, making it easier to ship and install.   <br />
        <br />
        Initially manufactured with steel which required palletizing and stacking for shipment, the new aluminum unit is 25 percent of the weight of the previous unit, making it easier to handle and install onto structures. The new bracket consists of three-pieces, is easy to assemble and ships in a box preventing damage to the unit. Furthermore, the bracket now includes banding slots added to the vertical body extrusion portion of the unit for more versatility in the attachment schemes to the structures.<br />
        <br />
        “We listened to our customers and engineered the aluminum coil bracket to help field technicians install faster. What was once a two or more person installation is now a one person installation,” commented Matthew Welborn, applications engineer for AFL’s accessories division.<br />
        <br />
        The aluminum coil bracket supports AFL’s SB01 and Opti-Guard splice enclosures and stores extra lengths of <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/ADSS.aspx">ADSS</a> or <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/OPGW.aspx">OPGW</a>. The Opti-Guard splice enclosure accommodates up to 504 single fusion splices. Easy to maintain and re-enter, the enclosure is light weight and mounts to many types of structures. The SB01 enclosure can store up to 25 feet of buffer tubes with 144 fiber splice capacity. Manufactured of iron and steel, this enclosure is weather and bullet-resistant.<br />
