        Last week, over 40 members of AFL’s sales organization volunteered time at Project Host Soup Kitchen, an organization that serves the hungry in downtown Greenville, SC, and at Homes of Hope, a nonprofit organization providing safe, quality and affordable housing for homeless and low-income families in the upstate of S.C. The two teams contributed in a number of ways including gardening, painting, cleaning and organizing materials.<br />
        <br />
        The Project Host volunteer team sorted and organized a pantry, prepping it for the upcoming holidays when donations are received fairly consistently. In addition, volunteers sorted clothing, prepped the day’s lunch and worked in the garden where mulch was spread and vegetables were picked.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Volunteers for Homes of Hope spent time at the new transitional house, painting the mud room and hallway and scraping the front exterior of the house. This is home to men who are overcoming drug and alcohol addiction. Job training and mentoring are provided in this home.<br />
         <br />
        <br />
        AFL’s sales team consists of professionals from across North America as well as representatives from South America, Europe and Australia. Because of the number of individuals participating, AFL chose two downtown nonprofit organizations for the volunteer work. After completing the on-site work, team members presented each organization with a check for $1,500.<br />
        <br />
        “Volunteering is a tradition for AFL, and I’m proud to be a part of our efforts to give back. In December, we volunteered at the Frazee Center in Greenville, and it just seemed right to do it again as part of our biennial sales meeting,” commented Jeric McCoy, regional sales manager from Missouri.<br />
        <br />
        AFL’s Community Outreach program is proud to host AFL Community Team (ACT) projects for a variety of nonprofit organizations throughout the year. To learn more about AFL and its community outreach, click here.<br />
