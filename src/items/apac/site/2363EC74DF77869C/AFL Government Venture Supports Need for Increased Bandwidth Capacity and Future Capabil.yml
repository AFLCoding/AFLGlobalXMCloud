        <div>Spartanburg, SC, USA and Melbourne, Victoria, Australia &ndash; A government venture in Australia has selected&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fibre optic cable, equipment, and accessories, to provide optical cables and connectivity for a key project in regional Queensland. AFL's optical cable solution leverages its Australian manufacturing capability and extensive experience with optical cables for harsh environments.<br />
        <br />
        The selected optical cable will provide protection against several environmental factors and will support key connectivity between facilities through the project lifecycle. The optical fibre,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fujikura.co.uk/products/fibre-and-optical-devices/single-mode-fibre/futureguide%C2%AE-ace/">Fujikura FutureGuide-ACE&reg;</a>, was selected for its all-band transmission capability and superior reduced-attenuation characteristics. Over 30,000 meters of cable has already been supplied for the project and was manufactured at AFL's facility in Victoria, Australia.<br />
        <br />
        As an optical fibre cable manufacturer, AFL is utilising its expertise to meet the evolving needs of modern government customers.<br />
        <br />
        "Customers are selecting FutureGuide-ACE&reg; in optical cables so that they can fully leverage modern active equipment," said Jim Boukouvalas, Portfolio Manager for Optical Cables at AFL in Australia. "Our experience and capability to manufacture optical fibre cables in Australia provides the in-country support many government customers need."<br />
        <br />
        The project demonstrates trends in optical networks that are driving the need for high bandwidth connectivity over single-mode optical fibres. For government customers, modern applications including distributed cloud, artificial intelligence and 5G enhanced connectivity solutions are required with significantly increased capacity and future capability. Additionally, critical government networks require cables that are resistant to tampering and environmental damage.<br />
