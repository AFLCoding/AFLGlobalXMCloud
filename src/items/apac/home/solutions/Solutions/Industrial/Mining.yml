        AFL offers a fully integrated portfolio of fiber optic solutions</h2>
        <h2>
        for the mining industry</h2>
        <p>
        To improve safety, meet new federal requirements and maximize profitability, the mining industry continues to upgrade its communications and monitoring infrastructure. Mining companies are looking to fiber optic systems as a cost-effective network alternative that will provide world-class communications solutions as well as additional benefits, including greater bandwidth for real-time voice, data and video applications.</p>
        <p>
        While investing in newer information technology infrastructures to meet the requirements of the Mine Safety and Health Administration's (MSHA) Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act, mine owners are looking for ways to leverage the capacity, capability and cost of fiber optic systems to measure and monitor air exchange and communicate in real-time. Coupled with the need to measure and monitor is the need to implement improved production efficiencies and use new sensor technologies and IP cameras. AFL's solution provides tracking and real-time communications for each miner.</p>
