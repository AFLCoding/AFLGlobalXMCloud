        <h1>Benefits</h1>
        <p>AFL’s benefits are designed to attract and retain valuable associates by providing coverage for healthcare and support during periods of crisis, such as illness or disability.</p>
        <p>Associates are eligible for coverage on the first day of the month following employment. AFL offers a full range of health and welfare benefits including medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, short term disability, long term disability, life, accidental death and dismemberment, and flexible spending accounts (health and dependent care). Benefits are offered at four different coverage tiers including associate only, associate plus spouse, associate plus children and family.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Medical Plans</h3>
        <p>AFL offers a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Plan to our associates. Our carrier for our Medical Plans is BCBS HealthCare.</p>
        <p>PPO plans give you the flexibility to use in-network or out-of-network providers without referrals, but your out-of-pocket costs will be lower when in-network providers are used. After the deductible is satisfied, the in-network services are covered at the coinsurance level. The plan pays 100 percent of your covered expenses once your out-of-pocket maximum is reached. <strong>Also, the plan pays 100 percent of in-network preventive care services</strong> (according to its preventive care schedule), regardless of whether or not you have satisfied the deductible.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Prescription Drugs</h3>
        <p>The prescription drug plan is included when you enroll in the medical plan.</p>
        <p>CVS/Caremark, the prescription drug carrier for our medical plan, provides access to thousands of chains and independent pharmacies. They also provide a mail order service that helps to control costs for you and AFL.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Dental Plans</h3>
        <p>Delta Dental is the administrator of our dental program. AFL offers two dental options under Delta Dental which are designed to give you flexibility in choosing your coverage level. These options include two plans—a Basic PPO Plan and an Enhanced PPO Plan. They offer a range of coverage levels and involve different out-of-pocket expenses.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Vision</h3>
        <p>The vision plan is a wellness benefit which helps you with the cost of eye exams and corrective lenses. After you pay a small co-payment, the plan generally pays 100 percent of your expenses when you use a vision care provider who is part of the VSP network. <strong>If you experience an illness or injury to your eyes, you would seek care through your medical plan.</strong> (For Safety Glasses Programs, see your EHS department.)</p>
        <br />
        <h3>401(k) Savings Plan</h3>
        <p>New associates are eligible to participate in 401(k) Savings Plan. AFL offers employer dollar-for-dollar match and vests after only one year! Associates may elect pre- tax, Roth or post-tax deferrals (only pre-tax and Roth deferrals are eligible for company match) and may make changes to deferral percentages at any time via the web or by telephone. The plan is administered by BB&T.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Dedicated Health and Wellness Coaches</h3>
        <p>AFL offers health coaches through Wellness Coalition America and on-site nurse practitioners (where available). These coaches are dedicated to assisting you with personal disease management and wellness initiatives.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Healthcare Spending Account</h3>
        <p>AFL offers two different healthcare spending accounts, the HCFSA and the HSA. These can be used for a variety of out-of-pocket medical, prescription drug, dental and vision expenses–for you and your eligible family members–that are not covered by any other benefit plan. You will not pay taxes on the portion of your income that goes into this account, which saves you money.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account</h3>
        <p>Dependent care flexible spending accounts (DCFSA) allow you to contribute pre-tax money into an account to pay for qualified dependent care expenses. You will not pay taxes on the portion of your income that goes into these accounts, which saves you money. You may contribute up to $5,000 ($2,500 if married, filing separately) per year to the dependent care flexible spending account.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Short-term Disability</h3>
        <p>Short-term disability (STD) coverage replaces a portion of your income if you sustain a qualified illness or injury that prevents you from working.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Long-term Disability</h3>
        <p>Long-term disability (LTD) coverage replaces a portion of your income if you sustain a long-term illness or injury that prevents you from working for an extended period.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Life Insurance</h3>
        <p>AFL provides basic life insurance coverage at no cost to you.</p>
        <p>You may choose additional coverage of one to five times your pay (rounded to the next higher $5,000). The minimum coverage amount for full-time regular associates is $25,000; there is no minimum for part-time regular associates. The maximum coverage amount for any associate is $1.5 million.</p>
        <p>During your new hire enrollment, you may choose any option; if the coverage amount is more than $500,000 or three times pay, evidence of insurability is required.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) Insurance</h3>
        <p>The AD&D plan pays a benefit if you die or are dismembered as the result of an accident. In the event of death, this benefit may be payable in addition to any life insurance coverage you have.</p>
        <p>AFL provides AD&D coverage at no cost to you. You may purchase additional AD&D coverage from one to five times your pay (rounded to the next higher $5,000). You may choose any option without providing evidence of insurability.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Associate Discounts</h3>
        <p>From time-to-time AFL vendors pass along special pricing or discounts to AFL associates. Participating vendors include:</p>
