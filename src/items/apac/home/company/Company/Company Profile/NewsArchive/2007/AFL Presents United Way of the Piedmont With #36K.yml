        Spartanburg, SC - On June 13, AFL presented a $36,833 check for its annual United Way campaign to Kathy Dunleavy, President, and Monica Cothran, Campaign Director of the United Way of the Piedmont. This year’s contribution is an increase of 270% in monetary contributions and 118% in employees who contributed to the campaign.<br />
        <br />
        Targeting a modest 18% increase over last year’s contributions, AFL set its goal for $13,000, but employees at AFL proved to be very generous.<br />
        <br />
        “United Way of the Piedmont goes to great strides to make sure the community needs are met through its annual campaign, working with the various businesses locally, as well as seeking input from the community to determine how the contributions are allocated,” said Jody Gallagher, President/CEO of AFL. “We’re pleased to be able to provide them with our contributions this year and we certainly thank our employees for helping to make this happen.”<br />
        <br />
        AFL approached this year’s campaign much differently than in year’s past. First, AFL kicked off its campaign with a corporate contribution of $5,000. A team of ten employees volunteered to be “ambassadors” for the campaign, assisting with getting the word out about the campaign and making themselves available to answer questions from employees and speak in departmental meetings about the campaign. Coin collection boxes were strategically placed around the two manufacturing plants in Duncan for spare change – most notably in the canteen areas.<br />
        <br />
        On May 10, local agencies from both Greenville and Spartanburg were invited to participate in an Agency Fair where employees were given the opportunity to visit each one, gathering information on the various human service agencies that partner with the United Way and do vital work in our community.  Lastly, AFL matched, dollar for dollar, the amount exceeded from last year’s employee contributions.<br />
        <br />
        “We’re excited that our campaign was so successful this year!” stated Sherise Brown, Human Resource Director and AFL’s United Way Campaign Director. “AFL and our employees believe that the United Way of the Piedmont invests their efforts to make our community a better place to work and live. We applaud their efforts!”<br />
