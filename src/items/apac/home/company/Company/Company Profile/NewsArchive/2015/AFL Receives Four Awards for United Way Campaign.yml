        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a leading global fiber optics manufacturer, was recognized by <a href="https://www.uwpiedmont.org/">United Way of the Piedmont</a> for various aspects of its annual United Way corporate campaign. AFL received four awards including a top award for Outstanding Employee Giving ($100K - $150K) and achieving the greatest percentage increase in associate giving. AFL set a personal record with a 12 percent increase in donor participation and 7 percent increase in its corporate contribution.<br />
        <br />
        “AFL has a culture of giving back to the community and we firmly believe that United Way is one of the best organizations that do this,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “Through this campaign, we are better equipped to understand the need locally and help our neighbors.”<br />
        <br />
        Themed “United in Caring – Paint a Brighter Tomorrow,” AFL’s campaign gave associates the opportunity to learn about United Way and various nonprofit organizations as well as give back to their community. The campaign included a personal message via video from AFL associates who have been directly impacted by an agency funded by United Way.<br />
        <br />
        AFL also received an award for Outstanding Creativity, for having a creative and innovative campaign theme and involving associates; Outstanding Campaign Committee, for demonstrating exceptional teamwork resulting in increased associate per capita giving; and lastly, Volunteer Spirit, for promoting involvement in their associates in community volunteer projects.<br />
