        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> is launching the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fusion-Splicing/Specialty-Fusion-Splicing-Equipment/Cleavers/CT-105-and-CT-106-Fiber-Cleavers.aspx">Fujikura CT-105 and CT-106</a> high precision, large diameter fiber (LDF) cleavers designed for specialty markets including oil and gas, research and development and medical. With the capability to cleave 80 μm to 1.25 mm diameter fibers, flat and angled, the cleaver’s programming features allow for optimal and consistent results.<br />
        <br />
        “Fujikura continues to expand its specialty fiber optic product line with technologies that support our customers’ needs around the globe,” commented Brad Hendrix, global specialty market manager for AFL. “When exceptional cleave quality is required for fibers up to 1.25 mm, the new cleaver family will provide both flat and angled cleaves that rival anything available on the market today.”<br />
        <br />
        The LDF cleaver provides extensive programmable features including a programmable automatic clamp function, an angle cleaving function (0 – 15° for fibers up to 800 µm), storage for up to 100 program modes, a blade life of 20,000 cleaves with a cladding diameter of 125 µm and applicable optical fiber, including glass optical fibers and capillary. Additionally, the product supports single fibers and features a color LCD monitor.<br />
        <br />
        The new cleavers provide advanced cleaving solutions for end-users in fiber and laser manufacturing, fiber sensor manufacturing across the oil and gas sectors, university and R&D divisions, submarine cabling, defense, optical components and medical applications.
