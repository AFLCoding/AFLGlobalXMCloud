        Spartanburg, SC – Five <a href=" /">AFL</a> associates were recognized for receiving patent awards for their work developing new <a href=" /Products ">products</a> and technologies.<br />
        <br />
        Ted Lichoulas, R&D engineering manager and Eddie Kimbrell, senior designer, received a patent for “method and apparatus for universal xDSL demarcation interface with multi-functional capability and signal performance enhancement.” Part of a Fiber-to-the-Node solution, the method splits the combined voice (POTS) and VDSL (data, video and VoIP) signal from the Telco central office and routes it to the point-of-use within a customer premise. Using this method, a carrier is allowed to use copper wiring on the last mile and provide triple-play services to a residence.<br />
        <br />
        Tony Nieves, global key account manager for AFL, and Chris Donaldson, R&D engineer at AFL, received a patent for “Optical Fiber Cable Connector.” This new invention allows the termination of traditional flat drop optical cable to a hardened fiber optic connector. The cable retention device, a one-piece structure, eases the assembly of the fiber and stress rod members to the optical connector. The patented design contains features that allow for proper alignment of fiber optic cable with enhanced cable strain-relief.<br />
        <br />
        Kheng Hwa Seng, director, supply chain management at AFL, received a patent for a "secured fiber optic connecting system and method using different fiber positions of a multi-fiber connector.” The technology uses one or more, but not all, fiber positions of a multi-fiber connector in order to achieve security in an optical interconnect system. <br />
