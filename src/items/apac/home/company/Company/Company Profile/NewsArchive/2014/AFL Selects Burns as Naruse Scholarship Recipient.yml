        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> presented the 2014-2015 <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/Community-Initiatives.aspx">Naruse Scholarship Award</a> to Emory Burns, a senior at Riverside High School in Greer, South Carolina. Burns’ exemplary high school accomplishments both academically and athletically along with his extensive volunteer involvement contributed to him being recognized with the Naruse Scholarship Award. Burns will attend the Calhoun Honors College at Clemson University in the fall where he will double major in biochemistry and genetics.<br />
        <br />
        Burns will graduate in the top 5% of his class at Riverside High and scored a perfect 800 on the math portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). Burns’ academic work has been recognized as an AP Scholar with Distinction, a STEM Scholar, a Palmetto Fellows Scholar, and a Clemson University Presidential Scholar. He was also a regional finalist for the University of Virginia’s Jefferson Scholars award. He is a member of the National Honor Society, BETA Club and Mu Alpha Theta, the Mathematics honor society, and was honored with the Riverside Senior Science Award earlier this month.<br />
        <br />
        Burns is also Captain of the State Champion Riverside High Academic Team, where he led the team to the first state championship for a Riverside Academic team. In June, the team will travel to Chicago to compete in the national championship. <br />
        <br />
        In addition to his outstanding academic record, Burns has excelled athletically and contributed to many volunteer and philanthropic projects. As a senior, Burns was Captain of the 4-A State Champion Riverside High Men’s Swim Team.  This was the first Riverside athletic team in any sport to win a 4-A state championship. Burns has served as an HSAP (<a href="http://ed.sc.gov/agency/programs-services/43/">High School Assessment Program</a>) tutor, helping other students prepare for a standardized test which is mandatory in order to graduate from high school in South Carolina.  He has also volunteered for the past two years at Meals on Wheels, and has participated in AFL’s Habitat for Humanity build.  Additionally, he has been active in the youth program at John Knox Presbyterian Church in Greenville.<br />
        <br />
        Burns is the son of Grant Burns, vice president and general counsel of AFL.<br />
        <br />
        Administered by the <a href="https://www.scholarshipprograms.org/">Center for Scholarship Administration</a> located in Greenville, South Carolina, AFL's Naruse Scholarship is awarded to eligible senior high school students of full time U.S.-based AFL employees with a minimum of one year of service.
