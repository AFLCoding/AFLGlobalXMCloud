        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a> and <a href="http://www.duraline.com/">Dura-Line</a> have joined together to develop a high-performance air-blown fiber optic cabling system - <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Solutions/Air-Blown-Fiber.aspx">eABF™ (Enterprise Air-Jetted Fiber)</a>. Engineered to offer a reliable, easy-to-integrate optical fiber network communications infrastructure, eABF has one of the highest fiber density solutions in the air-jetted fiber market. The eABF solution has several key elements that, when combined yield a state-of-the-art and highly flexible, future-proof communications pathway.<br />
        <br />
        “The eABF approach to structured cabling technology has the potential to change the industry by eliminating the initial high cost typically associated with traditional air-jetted fiber systems,” commented Stephen Martin, AFL product manager. “By removing this initial installation cost barrier, network designers will realize that the eABF solution can be their primary network pathway infrastructure.”<br />
         <br />
        The core of the eABF solution is the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Microcore/MicroCore--Blown-Fiber-Optic-Cable.aspx">cable</a> and <a href="http://www.duraline.com/content/futurepath">duct</a>. One of the unique features of the cable is the patent-pending low-friction high-drag jacketing system that enables the cable to move along the duct at a faster rate of speed. In addition, the eABF cable is Telcordia GR-409 compliant and flame-rated for OFNR and OFNP environments. As a result, the cable can be deployed within the cable raceway and management system once exiting the pathway without the need for additional costly furcation tubing. The cable geometry makes it ideal for installation in the Dura-Line 8.5 mm x 6 mm <a href="http://www.duraline.com/content/futurepath">Enterprise FuturePath®</a> system and is available in fiber counts up to 48 fibers. Fiber types include single-mode, OM2, OM3 and OM4 employing bend insensitive fiber technology.<br />
        <br />
        The eABF pathway system, developed by Dura-Line, is comprised of Enterprise FuturePath duct products and includes Indoor/Outdoor HDPE, riser, plenum and low smoke zero halogen (LSZH) options. All eABF ducts incorporate a low-contact, ribbed inner surface and ultra-low friction Silicore® lining which creates a low drag, high velocity cable jetting channel within the duct. Unlike other air-jetted fiber systems in the market, the eABF cable-duct combination also allows for installations, without the use of air, up to 1,000 feet. The eABF FuturePath duct comes in a variety of sizes and tube counts ranging from two through 25.<br />
        <br />
        “Distinct from traditional air-jetted fiber solutions for the enterprise market, eABF provides a solution that will maximize your investment, offering tremendous material and labor cost savings when future network bandwidth requirements need to be expanded or upgraded,” stated Stephen Martin, AFL product manager.<br />
         <br />
        Ideal for data centers, private networks, high-rise buildings, urban and medical campuses, the eABF solution is NEC 770 compliant for both raceways and ducts. A fully integrated solution, the eABF cabling solution comes complete with AFL connectivity, closures, enclosures, patch cords and connectors, fusion splicers and test equipment. The solution also includes design, Bill of Materials and SOW support, contractor training and project management. When the eABF solution is installed by a <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Services/Training/CLi-Certification-Program/CLi-Warranty-Terms-and-Conditions.aspx">CLi contractor</a>, the system is warrantied for 25 years.<br />
        <br />
