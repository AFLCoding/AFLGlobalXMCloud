        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> announces that the Quality Management System (QMS) of its <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories.aspx">Conductor Accessories</a> Division has been certified to the ISO 9001:2008 standard. This is the first certification for AFL’s Conductor Accessories manufacturing facility and the 11th ISO 9001 certification for AFL. To maintain ISO certification, companies must pass a registered third-party recertification audit every three years and a yearly surveillance audit. AFL’s Conductor Accessories facility, which manufactures substation and rail products, was approved for ISO 9001:2008 Certification with zero findings on its initial audit.<br />
        <br />
        “The ISO 9001:2008 certification is an incredible milestone for AFL’s Conductor Accessories Division," said <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Company-Profile/Leadership-Team/Eric-Borowicz.aspx">Eric Borowicz</a>, general manager, AFL, Conductor Accessories Division. "With this certification, our customers can be assured that AFL’s quality policies and objectives are implemented and achieved, and that they are receiving superior solutions for their applications."<br />
        <br />
        The certification is one of many milestones achieved by AFL's Conductor Accessories Division over the past two years. In 2012, AFL <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Company-Profile/News/2012/South-Carolina-Governor-Haley-Celebrates-AFL%E2%80%99s-Exp.aspx">expanded</a> to a fourth manufacturing facility for its Conductor Accessories Division in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The 143,000 square foot facility enabled the company to expand its electric utility accessories business that included additional jobs. To celebrate this expansion, AFL welcomed SC Governor Nikki Haley, local politicians, community leaders, media and other special guests as well as current AFL associates to an event that marked the occasion.<br />
        <br />
        Additionally over the last year, AFL introduced a high-efficiency <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Company-Profile/News/2014/AFL-Introduces-Stockbridge-Vibration-Damper.aspx">Dissipator Stockbridge vibration damper</a> for motion control on electrical utility lines and released a new line of <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Company-Profile/News/2013/AFL-Introduces-New-Swage-Bus-Accessories.aspx">Swage Bus Accessories</a> for substation applications. Another line of AFL’s Stockbridge Dampers were used to eliminate cable vibrations for daredevil Nik Wallenda’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Company-Profile/News/2013/AFL%E2%80%99s-Stockbridge-Dampers-Used-in-Wallenda%E2%80%99s-Grand.aspx">high-wire crossing</a> over the Grand Canyon.<br />
