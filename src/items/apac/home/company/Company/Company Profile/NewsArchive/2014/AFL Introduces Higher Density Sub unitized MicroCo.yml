        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a> expanded its <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection.aspx">connector inspection</a> product line by launching <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-Flex-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-System.aspx">FOCIS Flex</a>—a self-contained, tether-free, compact and handheld connector inspection probe. At the click of a button, FOCIS Flex auto-focuses, captures, centers and analyzes end-face images to easily display, transfer or store pass/fail results within seconds.<br />
        <br />
        “As networks move to higher data rates, operators are increasingly concerned about loss and reflections due to dirty or damaged connectors,” notes Michael Scholten, product marketing manager at AFL. “With the addition of FOCIS Flex, AFL offers the broadest line of connector inspection solutions, from low cost viewing scopes to Wi-Fi video scopes with automatic pass/fail analysis for smartphones and tablets, and now an untethered, completely automatic Bluetooth® video scope.”<br />
        <br />
        With rechargeable battery and integrated display, FOCIS Flex can be used completely independent of an OTDR or display unit, allowing technicians to easily view, analyze and save thousands of results internally. Additionally, technicians can pair FOCIS Flex with the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/FLX380-FlexTester.aspx">FLX380</a> or <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/OFL280_FlexTester_-_Handheld,_all-in-one_OTDR_and.aspx">OFL280</a> FlexTester ODTRs via Bluetooth to effortlessly view and save images and pass/fail results on those devices.<br />
        <br />
        FOCIS Flex is available with a wide range of interchangeable adapter tips to support the inspection of a variety of patch cords and bulkhead-mounted connectors with either PC or APC polished end-faces. FOCIS Flex is offered as a standalone kit or can be paired with a FLX380 or OFL280 in FlexTester <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/FLX380-OFL280-FlexTester-Complete-Kits.aspx">Complete2</a> or <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/FlexTester-PRO-Kit.aspx">PRO2</a> packages.<br />
