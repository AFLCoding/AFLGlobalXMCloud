        Halifax, Nova Scotia and Duncan, South Carolina - SolutionInc Limited (TSX-VEN:STL), a global leader in Internet management solutions, and AFL, a leading telecommunications product and services supplier, announced today that Davidson Hotel Company, owner and operator of 32 hotels in the continental US, plans to install SolutionInc’s high-speed Internet system in several properties. Davidson’s Crowne Plaza Hotel – Greenspoint in Houston, Texas, recently replaced its Internet system with SolutionInc’s award winning SolutionIP™ Internet system.<br />
        <br />
        Acquired by Davidson Hotel Company in 2007, the Crowne Plaza Houston North Greenspoint is in the final stages of a $12 million renovation which includes extensive technology upgrades throughout the property.  Ron Hardin – IT Director for Davidson Hotel Company comments, “We are extremely pleased to be working with AFL and SolutionInc to provide our hotel guests a reliable, stable and easy to access high speed internet service.  AFL’s team simplified the process of managing and implementing an extensive upgrade.”  <br />
        <br />
        The Crowne Plaza Houston North - Greenspoint is ideally located near Houston’s corporate headquarter corridor and a host of recreation and shopping options.  The 334 room property meets the needs of both leisure and business travelers with extensive on-site amenities and more than 17,000 square feet of meeting space.  <br />
        <br />
        SolutionIP is the Internet connectivity and billing management platform for the entire facility, including property-wide wireless services and wired access in the conference facilities and approximately one third of the guest rooms.  “The SolutionIP™ software not only enhances the internet experience throughout the property, but also supports the ability for property management to provide custom HSIA solutions,” said Clark Squires, Senior Vice President Sales and Partnerships of SolutionInc.  “We are very pleased to be working closely with AFL and Davidson Hotel Company to provide our service to their quality hotel brands.”<br />
        <br />
        In addition to the installation of SolutionIP as the HSIA connectivity and billing platform, AFL was also responsible for delivering other technology upgrades including a property wide mesh wireless solution, wired network upgrades and installation of a bandwidth shaping and traffic management solution.  “AFL’s goal is to help leading hospitality companies like Davidson Hotel Group simplify their approach to property technology by providing a single-source solution.  The Houston project is a showcase for how AFL’s team is able to support the entire process – everything from site survey to implementation and training of the hotel staff on their new system,”   stated Kent Brown, Director – Access Solutions, AFL.<br />
        <br />
        AFL is an established market leader in providing fiber-optic based telecommunications products and complete engineering, furnishing and installation (EF&I) services to telecom and enterprise segments.  AFL was responsible for integrating, installing and deploying SolutionInc’s SolutionIP™ system.<br />
