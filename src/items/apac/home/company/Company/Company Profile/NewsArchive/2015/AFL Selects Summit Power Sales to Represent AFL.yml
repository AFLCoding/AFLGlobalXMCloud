        In 2000, Jeremy Most, principle of Summit Power Sales, established the company.<br />
         <br />
        “By representing a select few manufacturers in a concentrated territory, we have had the opportunity to focus on our customers and serve with great dedication,” commented Most. “We have built strong relationships at the distribution level and with several leading contractors over the past 14 years. We look forward to working with AFL to strengthen their impact in the Rocky Mountain region.”<br />
         <br />
        Prior to starting Summit Power Sales, Most and a business partner opened Aspen Power and Telecommunications where they served the datacom, telecommunication and utility markets growing sales to more than $50 million covering six states.<br />
         <br />
        Most continues, “With our experience and AFL’s reputation in the industry, we are confident that we’ll be instrumental in helping AFL reach its goals.”   <br />
         <br />
        Working in tandem with Most is Carin Darr, outside sales representative. With 25 years of experience in the communications and distribution industries, Carin will provide support for customers in Colorado, Montana and Wyoming.<br />
