        Boston, MA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> awarded <a href="http://www.community-harvest.org/">Community Harvest Project</a> (CHP) a $2,000 grant made possible by AFL’s <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a>. The grant supports CHP’s Adopt-a-Row program which provides fresh fruits and vegetables to food pantries and community meal sites throughout Worcester County. In addition, the grant will also support the Harvest Home Family Farm Festival, an annual benefit event intended to bring the community together and raise funds to support CFP operations.<br />
         <br />
        “Community Harvest Project is the only nonprofit organization in the area dedicated to growing and donating highly nutritious food solely for the purpose of hunger relief,” said Abdel Soufiane, CTO and managing director of AFL’s specialty fiber division, Verrillon. “By providing healthy fruits and vegetables, CHP is improving the quality of life of recipients so they can live a healthier lifestyle.”<br />
        <br />
        In 2012, CHP grew and donated over 324,000 pounds of fruits and vegetables from farms in North Grafton and orchards in Brimfield, equating to nearly 1,100,000 servings of fresh produce for hunger relief. Over 9,500 volunteers served time in the fields and the greenhouse during that same year.<br />
        <br />
        “By taking direct, hands-on action at our farm, members of our community play an effective, visible role in solving a critical local problem—increasing access to nutritious fresh fruits and vegetables for more families in our community,” said Kristin Bafaro, CHP executive director.<br />
        <br />
        Community Harvest Project is now headquartered at the Brigham Hill Community Farm in North Grafton and includes White’s Farm in North Grafton and Cheney Orchards in Brimfield.<br />
        <br />
        Headquartered in Spartanburg, South Carolina, AFL manufactures fiber optic cable and accessories. Its North Grafton, MA facility specializes in designing and customizing specialized fibers for harsh environments including hermetic, high temperature, polarization-maintaining and rare-earth doped fibers. Fiber produced at this facility is now in use in multiple locations worldwide.<br />
        <br />
        AFL has an extensive community outreach program that consists of grants, sponsorships, employee engagement projects, disaster relief and more. For more information about AFL and its Community Outreach Program, visit <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">www.AFLglobal.com</a>.<br />
