        Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> has expanded its fiber optic cleaning product offerings with the addition of the <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Cleaning/Reel-types-Cleaners/OPTIPOP-R-Cassette-Cleaner-Series.aspx">OPTIPOP-R family</a> of refillable cassette cleaners. This family includes four models that can be used with common exposed-ferrule connectors, both single fiber and multi-fiber types: 
        <ul>
            <li>OPTIPOP-R1: single slot model for cleaning 1.25 mm and 2.5 mm ferrule connectors, including SC, SC2, FC, ST, MU, LC, MT, MPO/MTP® without guide pins (female) and MT-RJ without guide pins (female)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>OPTIPOP-R2: two slot model for cleaning 1.25 mm and 2.5 mm ferrule connectors, including SC, SC2, FC, ST, simplex and duplex MU, simplex and duplex LC </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>OPTIPOP-R3: single slot model for cleaning MPO/MTP connectors with guide pins (male)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>OPTIPOP-R4: single slot model for cleaning MT-RJ connectors with guide pins (male)</li>
        </ul>
        The <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Cleaning/Reel-types-Cleaners/OPTIPOP-R-Cassette-Cleaner-Series.aspx">OPTIPOP-R family</a> is used to dry clean the exposed ferrule end faces (UPC and APC) of fiber optic connectors, including the duplex LC and multi-fiber MPO. All four models yield more than 400 cleans per tape and the replaceable tape reels reduce the cost per clean to below $0.07 USD. The pre-washed micro-fiber tape cloth captures microscopic dust, particulate debris, oil and other contaminants to help ensure IEC/IPC end-face quality standards compliance. Constructed of tough ABS resin impregnated with an anti-static agent, the OPTIPOP-R cleaners are suitable for both inside and outside plant environments in service provider, enterprise and data center networks.<br />
         <br />
        “AFL now offers the most comprehensive <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Cleaning/Reel-types-Cleaners.aspx">fiber optic cleaning products portfolio</a> in the industry, covering push-type cleaners, cassette or reel-type cleaners, cleaning fluids, wipes and cleaning cards, cleaning sticks, tips and swabs,” commented Maury Wood, product line manager for AFL. “No matter the application or cleaning method preference, AFL provides the products and trusted know-how to help optimize fiber handling workflow.”<br />
         <br />
        The OPTIPOP-R family is ideal for FTTH drop cable installation and service restoration; data center fiber trunk turn-up and maintenance; pre-terminated cable production; electro-optic test and calibration laboratories and clean rooms; and service provider cable head-end and central office optical equipment upgrades. <br />
