        Spartanburg, S.C. – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> associates presented a $10,400 <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community/Community-Initiatives.aspx">Volunteers Choose</a> grant to the <a href="http://www.hopecfc.org/">Hope Center for Children</a> in Spartanburg. The Volunteers Choose program recognizes AFL associates who participated in volunteer programs during the previous year and provides each volunteer with the opportunity to vote for a nonprofit organization to receive this annual gift.<br />
        <br />
        The $10,400 Volunteers Choose grant was presented to Chamlee Loscuito, Executive Director of the Hope Center, and Lisa Hemond, Director of Development.<br />
        <br />
        “Hope Center for Children is so thankful for the investment AFL is making in children and families in this community,” said Lisa Hemond. “This donation of $10,400 will go a long way to help us. Partnerships like this are so important to Hope Center for Children. We could not continue to do with work we do without it.”<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://www.hopecfc.org/index.php">Hope Center for Children</a> is a place of safety and comfort for children who have been affected by abuse, neglect or abandonment. The center provides services such as home visitation, prevention-focused case management, emergency shelters, long-term residential care for children in foster care and assistance for children transitioning to new families.<br />
        <br />
        “Community outreach is a large part of AFL’s culture. Our associates care about their community and have a passion for supporting those in need,” said Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “This grant is a reflection of their efforts over the previous year and supports their interest in impacting children and families in the upstate of South Carolina.”<br />
        <br />
