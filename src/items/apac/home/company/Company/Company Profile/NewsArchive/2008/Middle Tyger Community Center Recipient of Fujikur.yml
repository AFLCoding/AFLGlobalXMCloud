        Spartanburg, SC - AFL announces that the Middle Tyger Community Center is the recipient of a $13,000 Fujikura Foundation grant to support the Short-Term Therapy Program. This is the third year in a row that the Foundation has supported this cause.<br />
        <br />
        “The Middle Tyger Community Center reaches out in so many different ways in support of a diverse group of people, playing a role that we feel is crucial to the health of our community,” said Corie Culp, Community Relations Manager for AFL. “As an integral part of where we work, live and play, we’re pleased to be able to continue our support of the community center.”<br />
        <br />
        Funds from the Fujikura Foundations are supporting the Short-Term Therapy program, benefiting young adolescent mothers, children and families. The goal of this program is to stimulate the internal resources for growth and development of the child and to help make their environment more responsive to their needs.<br />
        <br />
        “Even though the benefits of Short Term Therapy are impacting the way children and families handle stress and other challenges, many families cannot afford the service nor do they have insurance that will pay for counseling,” stated Wanda Fowler, Executive Director of the Middle Tyger Community Center. “We’re so pleased and thankful that AFL and the Fujikura Foundation believe in us and continue to support our endeavors, creating healthy families.”<br />
        <br />
        Short-term therapy allows the therapist to work with the child and his/her family for a number of sessions to assess the problem and lead the child and family to the appropriate resources. The therapist also interacts with parents and teachers to educate them, getting them engaged in the treatment of the child.<br />
