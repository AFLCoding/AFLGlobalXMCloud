        Spartanburg, SC - On May 21, AFL presented a $63,000 check for its annual United Way campaign to Kathy Dunleavy, President and CEO of United Way of the Piedmont. This year's contribution is an increase of 22% in employee participation and 19% in giving over last year.<br />
        <br />
        "AFL's associates put forth a great effort in keeping up the momentum this year," said Corie Culp, community relations manager of AFL. "As the economy struggles to regain strength, non-profit organizations have a larger burden to bear. We are committed to engaging AFL associates to make a difference in our community and in the lives of our citizens by getting involved with United Way and the agencies it serves."<br />
        <br />
        AFL kicked off its campaign with a corporate contribution of $5,000. To engage employees, AFL provided opportunities to learn about services in the area, participate in various events to raise funds, and be a part of team challenges. AFL ambassadors were recruited internally to answer questions and talk with other associates about United Way and its mission, as well as encourage associates to donate. An Agency Fair was held in April where 16 agencies from both Spartanburg and Greenville were invited set up a display and talk with associates about what they do, what their needs are and how they can help. AFL hosted a pancake breakfast, a chili competition and a company carnival where associates competed for prizes and bragging rights with a Wii Band Hero® and bowling competition, basketball hoops, speed pitch, and soccer kick and score. To further enhance the campaign, AFL matched, dollar for dollar, all monies donated over last year's employee contributions.<br />
        <br />
        "As we plan our annual United Way campaign, we want to make sure we are educating our associates about United Way and local agencies and generating excitement in giving time and resources to help others in need," said Sherise Brown, Human Resources Director. "We're pleased to continue supporting United Way year after year and we thank our employees for helping make a difference in the lives of so many people."<br />
