        Tukwila, WA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.lightbrigade.com/store/product.php?productid=1990&cat=76&page=1">The Light Brigade</a>, <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>’s education and training division, is partnering with <a href="http://www.fujikura.com.sg/">Fujikura Asia</a> and <a href="http://www.ite.edu.sg/wps/portal/itehome/itews">ITE College West</a>, both located in Singapore, to form a Resource Center at ITE College West. The center will provide students with access to a wide variety of fiber optics-related training material along with an FTTH showcase. This center, coupled with industrial placement at Fujikura Asia, will allow ITE students to learn from experts and acquire skills relevant to the fiber optics industry.<br />
         <br />
        The Light Brigade will offer training expertise, consultancy services and course material for ITE to ensure the program addresses the latest technology and techniques. The first of several planned training courses supports the <a href="http://www.lightbrigade.com/store/home.php?cat=95">Fiber to the Home Council’s Certified Fiber-to-the-Home Professional (CFHP) program</a>. Upon completion of the ITE training program, students will have the necessary knowledge and practical experience to successfully complete the <a href="http://www.ftthcouncil.org/p/cm/ld/fid=53">CFHP certification exam</a> accredited by the <a href="http://www.ftthcouncil.org/p/cm/ld/fid=1">Fiber to the Home Council</a>.<br />
         <br />
        “The Light Brigade is committed to support students and academia in the area of fiber optic expertise and certification,” commented Dario De Paolis, vice president and general manager of The Light Brigade. “We hope to inspire the next generation of designers, planners and technicians in the field of FTTH networks.” <br />
         <br />
        The FTTH showcase at the Resource Center will prepare students with market-related hands-on skills to develop an FTTH workforce by incorporating industry standards into relevant ITE courses. This showcase is sponsored by Fujikura Asia with equipment and consumables valued at $40,000.<br />
         <br />
        “We are delighted to have established a close working relationship with Fujikura and The Light Brigade,” stated Dr. Yek Tiew Ming, principal of ITE College West. “The collaboration will offer an excellent platform for the three parties to draw on each other’s individual strengths and synergize our resources. This partnership is a perfect example of the philosophy of ITE to continually engage industry to provide industry-relevant education that produces industry-ready technical specialists.”<br />
         <br />
        Toshi Takahashi, managing director of Fujikura Asia added, “Being one of the leaders in fiber optic technologies, Fujikura is privileged to contribute effectively to the industry and the local community in an educational collaboration with ITE. Education and continuous training are important necessities which enhance one’s knowledge and add value to the entire workforce.”<br />
         <br />
        The demand for higher speed data transmission is expanding at an astounding pace. Consumers require faster downloads for streaming video, voice, music and data. Fiber optic networks provide the pathway to move this data to the end user. This trend has sparked the need for a new generation of fiber optic personnel proficient in such networks. Realizing the need to meet new manpower demands, ITE will continue to keep its training up-to-date by working collaboratively with The Light Brigade and Fujikura Asia, both leaders in the fiber optic industry.<br />
        <br />
