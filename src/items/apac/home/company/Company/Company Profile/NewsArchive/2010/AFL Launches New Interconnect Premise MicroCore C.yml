        <p style="color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;">Spartanburg, SC - AFL announces the release of its new Interconnect Premise MicroCore Fiber Optic Cable, designed to support multiple channels at the highest data rates within a small footprint. In order to avoid issues that rise with preferential bend radius present in premise ribbon cable, the cable’s diameter was minimized, using multiple colored 250µm fibers and aramid strands. Packaged in a high performance PVC jacket, AFL’s Interconnect Premise MicroCore is suitable for mass terminations utilizing both MT and MP style connectors.<br />
        <br />
        Available in both simplex and zipcord designs with fiber counts from eight to 24, the interconnect cable is ideal for building interconnections, data center and central offices, meeting the interconnect standards of Telcordia GR-409 and are compliant to Directive 2002/95/EC (RoHS). Additionally, this cable design is available with OM3 and OM4 grade 50µm MM Laser-Optimized fibers for maximum performance of Ethernet architectures. OM3 grade 50µm MM supports 300m link distances for 10G Ethernet, while selection of OM4 grade 50µm MM can extend these link distances to 550m.
