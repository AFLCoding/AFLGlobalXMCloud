        <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> announces that the Quality Management System (QMS) of its NOYES Test and Inspection Division has been recertified to the ISO 9000:2008 standard. In addition, the Environmental Management System (EMS) was successfully audited and recertified to the ISO 14001:2004 standard. To maintain ISO certification, companies must pass a registered third-party recertification audit every three years and a yearly surveillance audit.<br />
        <br />
        "With this recertification to ISO 9000:2008, we have achieved more than 15 years of uninterrupted certification to this standard," said Mary Ruel, Quality & Regulatory Compliance Manager. "We are also pleased to have achieved five years of uninterrupted certification to ISO 14001, which demonstrates our goal to minimize the impact of our business and practices to the environment."<br />
        <br />
        The recertification is one of many milestones achieved by AFL's NOYES Test and Inspection Division over the past year. In April, the company established a new R&D, Marketing and Training Center in Lowell, MA. Over the past year, this division has released several new products including the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/DFS1-Digital-FiberScope.aspx">DFS1 Digital FiberScope</a>, <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/M200_Hand-held_OTDR_w_VFL_and_Touch_and_Test_Softw.aspx">M200 OTDR with Touch and Test™ technology</a>, <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/OTDRS-and-Fault-Locators/OFL280_FlexTester_--_Handheld,_all-in-one_OTDR_and.aspx">OFL280 FlexTester with ServiceSafe™ and Wave ID</a>, the <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Optical-Fiber-Identifiers/OFI-400_HP_Optical_Fiber_Identifier_(High_Power).aspx">OFI400HP optical fiber identifier for high power optical networks</a>, <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Talk-Sets-and-Attenuators/VOA6-SM_Variable_Fiber_Optic_Attenuator.aspx">VOA6 variable optical attenuator</a> and updated <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Talk-Sets-and-Attenuators">network activation kits</a>.<br />
