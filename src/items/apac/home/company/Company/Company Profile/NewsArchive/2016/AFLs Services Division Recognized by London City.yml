        Bracknell, UK and Spartanburg, SC – <a href=" /">AFL</a>, a global fiber optic cable and accessories manufacturer and provider of services, was the recipient of the <a href="http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/Pages/default ">City of London</a>’s Gold Award. Presented by The City of London Corporation in conjunction with their client, a world-leading telecommunications company, the Gold Award acknowledges companies that consistently exceed the requirements of the Code of Good Practice and have a regard for the surrounding environment by reducing disturbance to businesses and residences.<br />
        <br />
        The Sheriff of London, Alderman Charles Bowman presented the award to Kevin Seymour, Operations Director for <a href=" /Services ">AFL’s Services Division</a> in Europe.<br />
        <br />
        “It’s imperative that our work is completed as efficiently as possible so that Over clients projects are delivered as quickly as possible by minimizing the impact of the works to both their brand and the City of London and its residences, small businesses and corporations,” commented Seymour. “Our associates are dedicated to working with integrity and going above and beyond for our customers – whether it’s our customer or their customer. We are honored to be recognized for our efforts.”<br />
        <br />
        The City of London encourages companies within the community to participate in identifying any risks associated with their premises and to contribute to a safe and vibrant nighttime economy in the city. AFL’s services division introduced a new measure to reduce noise and disruption to both time economy and local residents and businesses, while carrying out essential duties for their clients throughout the night. AFL also worked collaboratively with the City of London in minimizing the time on-site and working with other utility contractors to reduce both site visits and disruption.<br />
