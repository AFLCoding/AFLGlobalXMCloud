        Spartanburg, SC and North Grafton, MA – <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Verrillon.aspx" target="_blank">Verrillon</a>, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AFL, is launching <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Verrillon/VHS-700-Series.aspx">VHS700 Series of Harsh Environment Single-mode Fibers</a> featuring ultra-low bend loss for use in tight bend applications. The single-mode VHS700 series fibers are available with coating combinations that can withstand temperatures from cryogenic to 300ºC including polyimide, silicone-PFA, silicone-MTA, MTA and carbon.<br />
        <br />
        With their optimized optical design, VHS700 fibers are engineered to operate under small bend radii down to 7.5 mm with minimal bend loss at 1550 nm. This low bend loss performance represents more than a 20X improvement over standard SMF. Additionally, the fibers are MFD compatible with standard SMF for ease of splicing and minimal splice loss.<br />
        <br />
        Suitable for use in high pressure, high temperature and corrosive environments, the VHS700 series fiber is available with carbon coating for both hermeticity against water and hydrogen in downhole applications and for fatigue resistance in long term deployments.<br />
        <br />
        Verrillon manufactures a host of optical fibers focused on high optical and mechanical reliability in harsh environments such as downhole distributed sensing, logging and imaging applications. AFL provides decades of engineering expertise in specialty fiber and cable innovation and manufacturing across many industries and applications.
