        Spartanburg, SC – Each year, <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> associates around the world take part in a Month of Service, engaging in projects that support our communities and invest in the future. Held throughout the month of April, nearly 90 AFL associates volunteered over 300 hours with four organizations—Hatcher Garden, Christmas in Action, the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Upstate and the Hope Center for Children. These projects are part of AFL’s extensive <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/Company/Community.aspx">Community Outreach Program</a> which consists of several initiatives including grant making, sponsorships and disaster relief.<br />
        <br />
        “Our associates give so much throughout the year – whether it’s their time or talents – they have compassion for our community and have a desire to reach out to help others,” stated Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL.<br />
        <br />
        AFL interns volunteered to stencil and paint letters, numbers, games, ladybugs and more on a Born Learning Trail at <a href="http://www.hatchergarden.org/">Hatcher Garden</a>. The Born Learning Trail consists of a set of 10 engaging signs to help parents and caregivers create learning opportunities for young children. These trails show parents and caregivers how to turn everyday activities into learning moments.  <br />
        <br />
        AFL associates and family volunteered on two different occasions for <a href="http://www.ciaspartanburg.org/">Christmas in Action</a>, an organization that rehabilitates the houses of low-income, elderly, disabled and otherwise disadvantaged homeowners to provide for their continued safety and independence. Associates donated their time scraping and repainting the trim while other associates built a wheelchair ramp.<br />
        <br />
        A team of AFL volunteers assisted the <a href="http://www.bgcusc.org/">Boys & Girls Clubs of the Upstate</a> at its annual Spring Fever Basketball Tournament. Volunteers refereed games, sold concessions or ran the front desk. The Boys & Girls Clubs provide after-school care for students of low income families by addressing five core areas: homework and academic enrichment; character and leadership; health and life skills; arts; sports, fitness and recreation.<br />
        <br />
        Lastly, nearly 25 AFL associates volunteer for the <a href="http://www.hopecfc.org/">Hope Center for Children</a> by landscaping, painting and cleaning the playground equipment. Additionally, the Hope Center received an ACT (AFL Community Team) grant for $1,500 as part of the project. The Hope Center for Children is committed to meeting a range of child and family needs in order to break the cycle of child abuse and neglect and build stable healthy families.<br />
