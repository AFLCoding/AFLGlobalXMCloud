        <p>
        At AFL, we understand that people shape our culture. That's why each associate is enabled to truly make a difference. AFL drives decision-making down into the organization. We know that the best concepts and processes come from associates on the front line with strong work ethics and enthusiasm to accomplish projects with integrity.<br />
        <br />
        Equal Opportunity Employer – We take our commitment to being an equal opportunity employer seriously and ensure a diverse workplace where alternative ideas and perspectives can flourish.<br />
         <br />
        Zero Tolerance of Harassment - We ensure our associates have a safe workplace where conflict is managed with transparency and confidentiality. Associates are held to the standards set in our zero tolerance harassment policy which prohibits offensive behavior based upon an associate’s sex, color, religion, race, age, national origin, disability and veteran status.<br />
         <br />
        Open Door Policy – We encourage effective two-way communication which enables all levels of management to conduct business seamlessly to enhance associate satisfaction. A dedicated, anonymous Global Compliance Hotline is available to all AFL associates to report fraud and HR-related issues.<br />
         <br />

        International Trade</h2>
        <p>
        AFL is committed to complying with all applicable export, import and trade compliance laws in all countries in which AFL does business. It is AFL’s policy that under no circumstances will sales or other transactions be made contrary to export or import regulations.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Importation Accountability</strong><br />
        The customs laws and regulations provide U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) with the authority to gather revenue and trade statistics as well as to enforce importation laws. CBP also has, to some extent, control over the exportation of goods from the United States. Import Trade Compliance is not only tied to CBP's regulations but also to regulations from other government parties including the Federal Communications Commission and the Food and Drug Administration.<br />
        <br />
        The Importer of Record, using reasonable care, must file an entry for imported merchandise and correctly declare the classification, value, rate of duty and other information such as country of origin, duty-free pursuant to special programs and free trade agreements and antidumping duties. This information allows CBP to properly calculate duties, collect accurate statistics and conclude whether appropriate legal requirements have been met.<br />
        <br />
        AFL requires all associates to comply with all U.S. laws and regulations related to the importation of goods as well as the specific regulations of each country in which we operate. AFL’s import compliance policy can be viewed <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=96FBAE03CD484AA186153DB029C1F14D&_z=z">here.</a><br />
        <br />
        <strong>Exportation Accountability</strong><br />
        The exportation or re-exportation of items (which may include products, technology and/or services) from the United States to a foreign country or to foreign persons within the United States, a "deemed export," is overseen by one of three U.S. government export control administrations: the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, the Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. These entities control the <a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/regulations/export-administration-regulations-ear">EAR regulations</a>, <a href="https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/itar.html">ITAR regulations</a> and <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx">Economic Sanctions</a> respectively. The details of the appropriate export control depend on the type of item being exported, the destination of the country, the identity of the recipient and the end use of the article.<br />
        <br />
        U.S. export control laws are very comprehensive and multifaceted. AFL associates whose jobs involve or are related to export activities are required to be familiar and comply with ITAR, EAR and other applicable U.S. export control laws and regulations as well as those of each country in which we operate. AFL’s export compliance policy can be viewed <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx">here.</a></p>
