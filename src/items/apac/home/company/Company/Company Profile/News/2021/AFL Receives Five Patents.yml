        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Home.aspx">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories,&nbsp;was awarded five new patents over the past quarter for technology and developments in <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=67697A36EE374C21A1F009672463F0E6&amp;_z=z">test equipment</a>,&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=DD697FB3AFEA42B2B976EB9288D04701&amp;_z=z">conductor accessories</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5A5DF654AF794D1EBAEEE22522AC6EB7&amp;_z=z">connectivity</a>.<br />
        Two patents were received in test and inspection. The first patent is for optical fiber connectors and mating adaptors with wavelength filtering components. Used in AFL&rsquo;s PON Power Meter, this invention allows for the capability of independently measuring the power levels of multiple upstream and downstream wavelengths when both GPON/EPON and XGS-PON signals are present in a single fiber. The second invention provides a means of obtaining bidirectional OTDR and insertion loss measurements using a single OTDR connected to the end of the network to be tested.<br />
        <br />
        Two patents were received for conductor accessories. The first is for the design and shape of swage press dies which aids in increasing the life cycle of the dies and preventing wear on other parts of the swage press. The second invention is for a protective PTFE (Teflon) encasement for strut insulators. The application of Teflon will allow AFL&rsquo;s products to have a longer serviceable life by reducing the degradation associated with polluting elements that break down the surface of these insulators.<br />
        <br />
        Lastly, AFL received a patent for a Wavelength Division Multiplexer (WDM) tray. This fiber optic tray system includes features that allow for the mixing and matching of various size modules (1/4, 1/2, and full width) by allowing them to snap into various positions.<br />
