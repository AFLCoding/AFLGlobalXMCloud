        Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, awarded two grants totaling $10,000 to <a href="https://miraclehill.org/">Miracle Hill Ministries</a> and <a href="https://www.upstatefrc.org/">Upstate Family Resource Center</a>. Made possible by AFL&rsquo;s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&amp;_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>, the organization&rsquo;s programs align with AFL&rsquo;s new focus area called LEAP (Life Enrichment &amp; Advancement Programs) which supports adults pursuing employment and self-sufficiency.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://miraclehill.org/">Miracle Hill Ministries</a>, an organization that provides shelter, food and comprehensive care for children and adults experiencing homelessness, received a $5,000 grant for its Jobs for Life (JFL) Employment Readiness Training program. The <a href="https://miraclehill.org/shelters/greenville-rescue-mission/">Greenville Rescue Mission</a> &nbsp;piloted JLF in 2021 to help homeless men who have significant employment barriers. Certified, volunteer instructors lead an eight-week course and take students through a nationally recognized curriculum, covering topics such as identifying roadblocks, vocational assessment and planning, character development, public speaking and interviewing skills, answering difficult questions, employer expectations, and much more. Each student is paired with a mentor who walks alongside the student and provides encouragement and accountability as he grows personally and professionally. Funding from AFL will expand the <a href="https://miraclehill.org/shelters/greenville-rescue-mission/">Greenville Rescue Mission</a>&rsquo;s JLF employment readiness program to two classes per year with 12 students and 12 mentors in each class.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.upstatefrc.org/">Upstate Family Resource Center</a> (UFRC), an organization whose mission is to achieve a healthier and more prosperous community by providing educational opportunities, engaging activities and support services to help families thrive, received a $5,000 grant for its Pathways to Progress program. The program is designed to assist families as they overcome barriers that impact financial stability. Funding will be used for partial salary support and will help design and develop a series of Micro-Learning Videos to be broadcast on UFRC&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe9rryYrxapxQFALZctB9ZA">YouTube channel</a>. The video series will be an educational tool for families and the community as individuals share information on financial habits, decision-making, parenting, and more. UFRC aims to provide clear education paths for adults without high school diplomas and develop career strategies with the individual&rsquo;s goals given priority.<br />
