        Belmont, New Hampshire and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and equipment, presented a $2,500 grant to the <a href="https://santafund.weebly.com/">Santa Fund of the Greater Lakes Region</a>, an organization dedicated to providing warm outerwear for children. The grant will provide for hats, coats, gloves, pants and boots during the colder months of the year.<br />
        <br />
        “One of our goals is to provide warm outerwear for children during the fall and winter so that families can prioritize their income on other necessary expenses such as rent and heat,” commented Kim Lacasse, co-chairwoman for the Santa Fund. “The funding from AFL will help so many children in our area. We are grateful.”<br />
        <br />
        Formed in November 1973, the Lakes Region Santa Fund Trust was created to assist families in need throughout the year. The Santa Fund provides support for summer camps, enrichment activities, sports programs and personal care needs while also focusing on providing children and youth with new winter outerwear. The Santa Fund partners with the Salvation Army, Saint Vincent de Paul, Central NH VNA & Hospice plus a number of other social service agencies.<br />
