        Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an industry-leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable and connectivity, is exhibiting at OFC, The Optical Networking and Communication Conference & Exhibition, and showcasing a host of new products. Visit Booth #4239 to see AFL’s 3,456F <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=740F36E4074A417CBAB68839104B5517&_z=z">Wrapping Tube Cable with SpiderWeb Ribbon®</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FDF30551384C4C55B6626D7D3D466816&_z=z">FOCIS Duel Inspection System</a> and board level optical connectivity solutions.   <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/productionFiles/images/News/AFL-SWR-Cable-with-WTC-PR.aspx" target="_self"></a><br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Cable/Wrapping-Tube-Cable/Wrapping-Tube-Cable-(WTC)-with-SWR.aspx">Wrapping Tube Cable (WTC) with SpiderWeb Ribbon® (SWR)</a> is an ultra-high density outside plant cable designed for fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) or access markets. With an ultra-high density ribbon technology called SpiderWeb Ribbon, WTC provides the smallest cable diameter and lowest weight, high-fiber count ribbon cable in the industry. The WTC-SWR cable is available with 144 fibers to 1,728 fibers in the armored option and up to 3,456 fibers in the non-armored configuration.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Test-and-Inspection/Fiber-Optic-Inspection/FOCIS-Duel-Fiber-Optic-Connector-Inspection-System.aspx">FOCIS Duel</a> is the world’s first fiber inspection probe with two optical ports—one optimized for fast subjective patch cord end-face inspection with the second port supporting all the comprehensive features of AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A5294A0B18184D9FBEABE71007538173&_z=z">FOCIS Flex</a> inspection system. FOCIS Duel’s Bluetooth® transceiver interworks with AFL’s FOCIS app for iOS and Android smart devices. The FOCIS app provides connectivity to AFL’s aeRos® cloud-based workflow management platform and features other highly valuable capabilities, feature set as well as connectivity with cloud-based <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4C1A455A2E234F3A968C0A26C07049A8&_z=z">aeRos® workflow automation platform</a>.<br />
        <br />
        New products for board level optical connectivity solutions that support ultra-fast networking and high performance computing equipment will be showcased. AFL is offering blind-mate mid-plane and backplane connectivity solutions using Fujikura’s Lensed Single-mode MT ferrule.  This expanded beam solution provides the best balance of insertion loss and durability performance for mating high density, single-mode ganged connectors used in high performance computing, data center switching and routing applications. Ganged, blind mate connectors utilizing up to 15 ferrules in one connector have been developed.<br />
        <br />
        Also showcased will be a new 12-fiber, 80 µm MPO connector which supports the continued drive by module and switch manufacturers to increase fiber and port density. Fujikura has developed a family of short length MPO Receptacle connectors for modules with significant internal space constraints. Some receptacles can be assembled after MPO termination. Solutions are provided for both 3.5 mm and 8 mm MT ferrules. Lastly, Fujikura has developed a unique 80 µm High NA, low mode field, TEC fiber that enables higher density interconnect to silicon photonics solutions.<br />
        <br />
        Special presentations will take place in the Test & Measurement Center (Booth #5623/Table 4):<br />
