        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an international manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, shared Arbor Day in South Carolina with students, teachers and staff of Beech Springs and Berry Shoals Intermediate schools by providing more than 1,000 pine trees. The gift of trees is part of AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=8DE570ADF7D04820B1251770EB585866&_z=z">Thrive program</a>, a commitment to preserve the environment by planting trees, conserving energy and reducing environmental impact.<br />
        <br />
        AFL launched the program in 2006 with a goal to donate 5,000 trees worldwide by 2010. Having exceeded that goal, AFL doubled its target with a goal to donate10,000 trees by 2015. By the end of 2015, approximately 14,000 trees were gifted. AFL continued to increase its goal and just surpassed donating more than 25,000 trees.<br />
        <br />
        In 2020, AFL set a new goal to donate an additional 20,000 trees by 2025. AFL locations around the world will participate in this program with many associates volunteering to plant indigenous trees for schools or other organizations.<br />
        <br />
        “Our Thrive program provides a great opportunity to involve our associates, their families and friends, and give back to the community at large,” explained Corie Culp, community relations manager for AFL. “We look forward to partnering with our local Intermediate Schools each year. It’s a great opportunity for students to learn more about AFL, the purpose of Arbor Day, and how they can individually impact our environment.”  <br />
        <br />
        AFL is ISO 14001 EMS certified and an active participant with <a href="https://www.palmettopride.org/">PalmettoPride’s</a> <a href="https://www.palmettopride.org/get-involved/pickup-programs/palmetto-prideways/">Prideway</a> initiative. AFL sets aggressive goals to continuously conserve energy and reduce environmental impact.
