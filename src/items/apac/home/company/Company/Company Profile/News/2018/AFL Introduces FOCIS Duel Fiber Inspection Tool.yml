        Lowell, MA and Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a> introduces <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=FDF30551384C4C55B6626D7D3D466816&_z=z">FOCIS Duel</a>, a field-ready, handheld digital inspection microscope offering optimal LC connector analysis performance to reduce fiber handling operating costs (OPEX). FOCIS Duel is the world’s first fiber inspection probe with two optical ports, one optimized for fast subjective patch cord end-face inspection, with the second port supporting all the comprehensive features of AFL’s award-winning <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=A5294A0B18184D9FBEABE71007538173&_z=z">FOCIS Flex inspection system</a>. FOCIS Duel features female “plug-in” connector adapters, which facilitate rapid end-face inspection operation, and the LC adapters mechanically accommodate duplex LC connectors which are commonly used in data centers.<br />
         <br />
        AFL is demonstrating the FOCIS Duel inspection system in the New Products Pavilion of the 2018 BICSI <em>Winter</em> Conference & Exhibition in the Orange County Convention Center - West Concourse February 6 - 8.<br />
         <br />
        To support demanding, rugged and time-sensitive environments, FOCIS Duel has no moving parts and requires no operator adjustments to deliver fast automatic image analysis to industry standards and custom criteria. Linked wirelessly to AFL’s <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4C1A455A2E234F3A968C0A26C07049A8&_z=z">aeRos® cloud-based work flow management platform</a>, FOCIS Duel is a complete solution—from field testing to standards-compliant analysis to record archiving and network management.<br />
         <br />
        “There is an insatiable ‘need for speed’ in the modern data center and until there is an inspection solution that is both efficient and reliable, hyperscale data center managers have a tendency to avoid end-face inspection and cleaning from a cost benefit perspective,” explained Maury Wood, senior product line manager with AFL’s Test & Inspection Division. “With end-face contamination now recognized as the leading cause of network performance degradation and failure, stakeholders need a reliable and cost-effective solution to end these preventable network outages. With AFL’s FOCIS Duel, there is now a super-fast and affordable simplex and duplex LC inspection solution that ensures optimal and reliable network performance.”<br />
         <br />
        FOCIS Duel’s Bluetooth® transceiver interworks with AFL’s FOCIS app for iOS and Android smart devices (phones and tablets). The FOCIS app provides connectivity to AFL’s aeRos® cloud-based workflow management platform and features other highly valuable capabilities, including pinch-to-zoom on endface images, clear and straightforward tabular presentation of inspection results, image and report sharing by email and text.<br />
         <br />
        FOCIS Duel operating features include UPC and APC adapters, auto-focus, auto-capture, auto-analysis to IEC and IPC rules, image saving, image/tabular data/pass and fail results transfer over Bluetooth and PDF report generation. With a 2.4” TFT LCD display, six soft buttons, a straightforward GUI, instant on, small and lightweight form factor, FOCIS Duel is easy-to-use and enables exceptional productivity, leading to significantly reduced operating expenses for fiber optic network owners and maintenance contractors.<br />
