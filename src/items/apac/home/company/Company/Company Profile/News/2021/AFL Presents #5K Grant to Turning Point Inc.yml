        <div>Monroe, NC and Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a provider of services and manufacturer of fiber optic cable and accessories, presented a $5,000 grant to&nbsp;<a href="https://turningpointnc.org/about-us/mission/">Turning Point</a>, Inc. based in Monroe, North Carolina, for its Domestic Violence Program. The grant, made possible by AFL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F5E14B660F224CD79DB21F673AE9DB95&amp;_z=z">Community Outreach Program</a>, will support wireless connectivity plus laptops and accessories needed for clients/students to complete school work.<br />
        &ldquo;As COVID restrictions have impacted attendance at school and virtual teaching is mainstream, children need access to tools that enable continued learning,&rdquo; explained Seneca Mullins, vice president of AFL&rsquo;s Enterprise Services group. &ldquo;Education is a top priority for all of us. This grant will ensure that the children in care at Turning Point have what is needed to get the best education they can.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        Prior to COVID, children&rsquo;s homework was completed on one shared tablet or computer in a common area with access to WiFi. With the advent of COVID, children in care at Turning Point have turned to virtual schooling. Homework is no longer completed in a common area given CDC social distancing recommendations and must now be completed in individual rooms. The AFL grant will be used to expand wireless connectivity in the shelter to each room plus purchase laptops and accessories needed for clients.<br />
        <br />
        Jessie Lindberg, executive director of Turning Point commented, &ldquo;It is imperative that the children residing in our shelter have access to sufficient technology, given virtual schooling and social distancing guidelines. We want to ensure that their lives maintain normalcy and consistency while they are with us.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://www.turningpointnc.org/">Turning Point's</a>&nbsp;domestic violence shelter and services are a haven for victims and their dependent children. All basic needs are provided while in shelter: toiletry items, over-the-counter medication, clothing, three meals and two snacks a day. Also provided are financial assistance, a 24-hour hotline, crisis intervention and referrals, counseling, case management, victim advocacy, parenting classes and children&rsquo;s programs.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://www.turningpointnc.org/">Turning Point</a>&nbsp;takes a family-centered approach and adults learn the impact that domestic violence has on their children. Turning Point serves the &ldquo;silent witnesses&rdquo; who have been exposed to domestic violence, teaching them how to communicate without the use of violence. Turning Point assists youth in becoming successful adults through its early childhood program, children's HERO program, and a Teen Dating Violence Prevention Program.<br />
        <br />
        Turning Point is the only program in Union County that provides services to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and child sexual and physical abuse. Visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.turningpointnc.org/">www.turningpointnc.org</a>&nbsp;to learn more about Turning Point.<br />
