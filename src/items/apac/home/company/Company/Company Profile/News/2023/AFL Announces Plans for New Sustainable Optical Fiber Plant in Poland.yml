        <p>Spartanburg, S.C. | October 18, 2023 | AFL, a subsidiary of Fujikura Ltd. and global  leader in optical fiber network infrastructure, today announced plans to  construct a state-of-the-art, sustainable manufacturing facility in Poland to  meet rapidly growing bandwidth needs across the region. The new facility is  expected to open mid-2024 and will enable AFL to meet customer delivery  expectations and more efficiently serve regional customers.</p>
        <p>"With data usage skyrocketing, fiber  networks across EMEA are expanding rapidly," said Steve Polidan, Vice  President of Connectivity at AFL. "A new factory in Poland will position  us closer than ever to our customers, allowing us to deliver the optical  solutions they need quickly."</p>
        <p>"Enhancing the customer experience is a key  driver for this expansion. By locating production closer to our customers, we  can improve delivery speeds and responsiveness. This will allow us to better  serve their business needs as demand rapidly scales across the region"  Polidan continued. "Sustainability is also central to our expansion  strategy. The plant will help AFL reduce its environmental impact through  energy efficiency, waste reduction, conservation, and other initiatives."</p>
        <p>Poland's central European location, skilled  workforce, and support for green manufacturing make it an ideal choice for AFL  and a perfect fit as they grow their production footprint to keep pace with  customer demands across the region.</p>
        <p>The Poland facility will become AFL's fourth  European production center, joining existing optical cable factories in the UK  and Germany and assembly/hardware manufacturing in the UK. The expansion  reflects AFL's priority to locate sustainable manufacturing and logistics close  to major hubs and enable faster customer deliveries.</p>
