        <div>Spartanburg, SC – <a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, an industry-leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable, equipment and accessories, is exhibiting at <a href="http://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/photonics-west?SSO=1">SPIE Photonics West</a>, and showcasing its latest fusion splicing equipment, connectivity solutions and specialty fiber. In booth #557, AFL will be showcasing the LZM-120A+ LAZERMaster™ Splicing System, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=F151ABBB387443BCB4D123DEDBDDCEA3&_z=z">Fujikura CT-105 LDF Cleavers</a>, Board Level Fiber Connectivity and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5AB6A30E51E6470DADAF45066D58C314&_z=z">Specialty Optical Fibers</a>.
        <br />
        AFL’s new LZM-120A+ LAZERMaster™ Splicing System is an optical fiber processor/splicer featuring fiber ablation. This new splicing system can splice on endcaps and create ablated cladding mode stripping in one process. Check out our special demonstration of this new product on Tuesday, February 5 at 2:00 p.m. in AFL’s Booth #557.<br />
        <br />
        The Fujikura CT-105 LDF Cleaver will also be featured. This product has the ability to cleave fibers up to 1,250 μm and the ability to provide both flat and angled cleaves using an automatic clamping system with programmable force. The color LCD shows cleaving progress and recommended insert size depending on fiber coating and cladding diameter, and the USB port allows for saving and storing cleaving programs to a PC or tablet.<br />
        <br />
        AFL will also be showcasing board level fiber connectivity solutions that link embedded optical modules to the card edge, blind-mate mid-plane connectors and backplane solutions. These “Inside the Box” fiber connectivity solutions are for ultra-fast networking and high performance computing equipment.<br />
        <br />
        Specialty optical fibers are the driving technology for a variety of industries, and will also be displayed in the AFL booth. These fibers are designed for harsh environments, polarization-management and specialty applications.<br />
        <br />
        Attend AFL’s poster presentations on Tuesday, February 5 from 6:00-8:00 p.m. in the Marriott Marquis Hotel, Golden State Ballroom. Gongwen Zhu, applications engineer, will be presenting “High efficiency mode field adapters fabricated with CO2 laser splicer” and Amine Jebali, development engineering manager, will be presenting “CO2 glass ablation for the micro fabrication of fiber components for medical and sensing applications.”<br />
