        <div>Spartanburg, SC &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aflglobal.com/">AFL</a>, a manufacturer of fiber optic cable, connectivity and accessories, is launching the next-gen&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B216F09D2A9B453583CEF11753CEA116&amp;_z=z">FUSEConnect MPO splice-on field-installable connectors</a>. The FUSEConnect MPO&rsquo;s updated design migrates from a mechanical splice protection clamp to a heat protection sleeve, using an on-board splicer heater and eliminating the need for a separate mechanical clamp tool. Designed to utilize standard ribbon,&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=740F36E4074A417CBAB68839104B5517&amp;_z=z">SpiderWeb Ribbon&reg;</a>, or loose tube cable, this connector helps minimize the complexity involved in the termination of multi-fiber connectors.<br />

        <br />
        &ldquo;As we explored ways to improve on the FUSEConnect MPO, we focused on the viewpoint of field technicians&hellip;how could we adapt this connector to make it easier during installation,&rdquo; explained Sadie Waycaster, optical connectivity product manager for AFL. &ldquo;The result is in the process. By using a heat sleeve protector design, the overall termination process is cleaner, faster and more efficient.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Fiber-Optic-Connectivity/Field-Installable-Connectors/FUSEConnect-MPO-Splice-On-Field-Installable.aspx">FUSEConnect MPO</a>&rsquo;s factory pre-polished ferrule allows for a field-termination process that eliminates the need for polishing, adhesives and crimping in the field and minimizes the potential for operator error and expensive connector scrap. The splice-on connector is designed to be used with the RT-02 ribbonizing tool which does not require glue, resulting in a cleaner termination process.<br />
        <br />
        The FUSEConnect MPO is part of the&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=7E8A85D6863D475DB0191011E6B3131F&amp;_z=z">FUSEConnect splice-on connector family</a>&nbsp;which includes SC, LC, ST and FC style connectors. FUSEConnect MPO performs as an equivalent to the standard factory terminated MPO/MTP&reg; assemblies. AFL offers a&nbsp;tool kit&nbsp;as well as a variety of accessories for FUSEConnect MPO application.<br />
